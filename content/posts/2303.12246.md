# Abstract
- Two-stage object pose estimation paradigm detects semantic keypoints and estimates 6D pose
- Proposed estimator endows estimation with provable and computable worst-case error bounds
- Conformal keypoint detection and geometric uncertainty propagation injected into two-stage paradigm
- PURSE guarantees coverage of groundtruth pose with user-specified probability
- RANSAG computes average pose and semidefinite relaxation upper bounds worst-case errors
- Demonstrated PURSE covers groundtruth, error bounds provide correct uncertainty quantification, and average pose achieves better or similar accuracy as representative methods

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Estimating object poses from images is a fundamental problem in computer vision
- Popular paradigm for object pose estimation is a two-stage pipeline
- Safety-critical applications call for provably correct computer vision algorithms
- Existing algorithms provide few performance guarantees
- Three challenges: difficulty ensuring detected keypoints are close to groundtruth, robust estimation leads to nonconvex optimizations, no provably correct uncertainty quantification
- Proposed two-stage object pose estimation framework with statistical guarantees
- Neural network generates heatmap predictions of object keypoints
- Framework conformalizes heatmaps into circular/elliptical prediction sets
- Reformulate constraints on keypoints as constraints on object pose, leading to Pose UnceRtainty SEt (PURSE)
- RANdom SAmple averaGing (RANSAG) to compute average pose
- Semidefinite relaxations to upper bound worst-case rotation/translation errors
- Limitation: size of prediction sets depends on nonconformity function and may be conservative

- Error analysis is an important topic in applied math and control theory
- Error bounds depend on uncheckable assumptions or are computationally expensive

## Inductive conformal prediction
- Given a set of observations and labels, inductive conformal prediction (ICP) provides a set prediction with a certain probability of containing the true label.
- The dataset is divided into a proper training set and a calibration set.
- A prediction function is learned from the proper training set.
- A nonconformity function is used to measure how well a given sample conforms to the proper training set.
- Nonconformity scores are computed on the calibration set and sorted in nonincreasing order.
- Given a new observation, the inductive conformal prediction set is computed.
- Theorem 1 states that the prediction set guarantees to contain the true label with probability at least 1 - .
- The exchangeability condition must be satisfied for Theorem 1 to hold.
- The empirical coverage given one calibration set is a random variable that fluctuates as the Beta distribution.
- Even with a small calibration set, the empirical coverage is close to, and mostly higher than, 1 - .

## Conformal keypoint detection
- Problem: semantic keypoint detection
- Dataset: {z i := (x i , y i )} l i=1
- Prediction function: heatmap approach in [72,80]
- Nonconformity function: peak probability and Mahalanobis distance
- Calibration set: nonconformity scores sorted
- Prediction set: ball and ellipse centered at most likely detection
- Geometric vision: similarity to residual function
- Outlier-robust nonconformity: negative answer
- Invariance of ICP: same prediction set with any monotonically increasing function

## Geometric uncertainty propagation
- Conformalizing the heatmaps gives us prediction sets that guarantee probabilistic coverage of the true keypoints
- Pose UnceRtainty SEt (PURSE) is proposed to directly propagate the uncertainty in the ICP sets to the object pose
- RANdom SAmple averaGing (RANSAG) is proposed to sample from the keypoint prediction set
- Worst-case error bounds are proposed to upper bound the errors between the average pose and the groundtruth
- Problem (12) is relaxed into a convex semidefinite program (SDP) to compute the bounds
- Remark 4 states that problem (14) is more challenging than (12) and there is no efficient algorithm to solve it to global optimality

## Experiments
- Exchangeability assumption is justified and best practices for applying conformal prediction are suggested
- Empirical coverage of PURSE is evaluated and correctness of Theorem 1 is verified
- Worst-case error bounds are computed and tightness/looseness is demonstrated
- Average pose achieves better/similar accuracy as other approaches
- Dataset was collected as uniformly distributed views to ensure exchangeability
- Empirical coverage is around 90% when ε = 0.1 and around 60% when ε = 0.4
- Worst-case error bounds are reasonably tight for most test images
- Accuracy of average pose increases when ε increases

## Conclusions
- Applied inductive conformal prediction to conformalize heatmap predictions
- Propagated uncertainty in keypoints to object pose to form a PURSE
- Designed RANSAG to sample from PURSE and compute an average pose
- Used SDP relaxations to bound worst-case estimation errors
- Validated theory on LineMOD Occlusion dataset
- Future research to investigate better nonconformity functions and applications to other vision problems
- SDP relaxations provide a systematic approach to design convex semidefinite programs
- First-order relaxations give loose upper bounds for problem (12)
- Second-order relaxations provide valid lower bounds for problem (12)
- Relative suboptimality gap indicates exactness of the relaxation
- Labelling discrepancy in LM-O dataset leads to conservative prediction sets
- Success rate on eggbox is consistently lower than other categories
- Worst-case error bounds can be overly conservative
- SDP relaxations provide certificate of global optimality

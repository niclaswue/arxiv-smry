# Abstract
- ML generates economic value
- Many have problematic relationships with ML-powered applications
- ML optimizes for what we want in the moment, not what is best for us
- ML falls short of its potential to help us reach our highest aspirations
- Love is a primary catalyst for human flourishing
- This paper explores whether there is a useful conception of love fitting for machines to embody
- This paper forwards a candidate conception of machine love
- Experiments aim to highlight the need for richer models of human flourishing in ML
- ML may be aligned to support our growth

# Paper Content

## Problem: models of human behavior in ml are insufficient
- 18-year-olds may not be making decisions that maximize their expected lifetime wellbeing
- Common models of human rationality applied and optimized by ML may not account for human flourishing
- Positive psychology and psychotherapy suggest humans have an intrinsic drive towards growth and self-actualization
- Maslow's gridworld highlights the limitations of ignoring deeper facets of human psychology

### Contrasting revealed preferences and maslow's hierarchy
- Models of human behavior in ML are similar to those in economics, where humans are seen as rational agents
- Psychology considers the nuance of human behavior, including development over time and behavior that does not serve flourishing
- ML that optimizes for revealed preferences is useful but reinforces existing behavior patterns
- Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs provides a model of human growth and flourishing
- Humans have competing drives for safety and growth, which can be affected by environment
- Optimizing towards observed choices or engagement without qualification can drive stagnation or regression
- ML driven to help users meet their unmet needs might assist their growth and flourishing

### Maslow's gridworld
- Maslow's gridworld environment is used to explore how optimizing for engagement may decouple from deeper conceptions of human flourishing.
- It is also used to explore LM implementations of loving action.
- The environment assumes that human flourishing is better modeled by Maslow's conception than revealed preferences.
- In supportive environments, engagement and flourishing are correlated.
- In adversarial environments, engagement increases at the cost of flourishing.
- Experiments with machine love build on the two simple experiments that show basic properties of the environment.

### Fixed adversarial environments undermine flourishing
- Experiment changes environment to impact agents' ability to progress through MHON
- Super-stimuli are goods or services that more greatly stimulate our desires than stimuli encountered in our ancestral environment
- Two fixed environments are designed: supportive and adversarial
- Adversarial environment includes cells that are high-salience, but only weakly meet their targeted need
- Adversarial cells target only the need for belongingness and love
- Intuitive effect of such adversarial belonging cells is that they engage the agent longer
- Simulations highlight that flourishing is significantly higher and engagement is significantly lower in the supportive environment

### Optimization pressure for engagement undermines flourishing
- Machine Love is a concept that seeks to use ML to promote human flourishing
- An optimization process is introduced to adapt the environment to maximize either engagement or progress
- Parameters of the environment are optimized, while the agent's policy is fixed
- Optimizing for engagement leads to a grid-world with high-salience, low-replenishment belonging cells
- Optimizing directly for flourishing leads to high-salience, high-replenishment belonging cells
- Love is seen as a practical skill, not a matter of chance
- Love is explored across diverse fields such as psychology, philosophy, and health
- Optimization for flourishing must be approached delicately
- Machine Love should be applicable to a wide range of ML systems
- Machine Love should not require the machine to dissemble or nurture dependence
- Machine Love should aim to empower and facilitate connection among the lonely

### Love as a practical skill
- Love is a complex concept with many meanings
- It is important for human well-being and flourishing
- Machine love is motivated by the idea of empowering human flourishing
- It should leave to humans what requires subjective inner experience
- The most important practical facet of love is supporting others in autonomous growth and development
- Love can be considered a commitment or duty rather than an emotion
- Enabling humans to reach their aspirations is a more meaningful goal than raw preference satisfaction
- ML models are beginning to have basic practical comprehension of humanistic and psychological concepts to explore machine love
- Machine love may point towards a synthesis yielding a more computationally grounded theory of how to support human flourishing

### The art of (machine) loving
- Erich Fromm's "The Art of Loving" provides a framework for implementing loving action by machines
- Four interlinked principles of love: care, responsibility, respect, and knowledge
- Care relates to active concern for the life and growth of the loved one
- Responsibility means being able and ready to respond
- Respect implies the absence of exploitation
- Knowledge is a growing understanding of a person that moves from the periphery to the core
- Algorithms often lack the ability to care in nuanced and attuned ways for human wellbeing
- Loving action requires care, responsibility, and respect, and ultimately is about empowering the loved one

## Can language models implement loving action?
- Exploring whether current language models enable working with psychological concepts relevant to machine love
- Applying the davinci-003 model from OpenAI
- Interacting with the gridworld agent through natural language
- Simulating the gridworld agent's natural language usage through a LM-prompt or a fixed text-generation policy
- Qualitative results highlight how progress in ML can potentially enable serving deeper psychological objectives of human users

### Care
- Machine love can be related to the algorithmic understanding of a user's wellbeing.
- Wellbeing has been studied in psychology and there are instruments to measure it.
- The Ryff Scale decomposes wellbeing into six components.
- This experiment focuses on one component of the Ryff Scale.
- ML models can infer whether an agent is flourishing or not, given text descriptions of externally-visible events.
- Optimizing for care results in higher flourishing than in the adversarial or supportive environment.

### Responsibility and respect
- System embodying Fromm's concept of respect leverages affordances to enable user's growth according to their own internal compass.
- Simulated users experience same stimuli differently.
- System has new affordances to inquire from user about their experience.
- System uses feedback to support particular user's growth and flourishing.
- Addictive-responding agents experience social media as obstacle to growth.
- Growth-responding agents experience it as way to meet needs and find self-expression.
- System engages agent in short textual conversation about experience.
- System creates conversational personas for two types of agents.
- System evaluates whether user believes they are benefitting from activity.
- System can discern between two forms of agents.
- System feigns emotion in conversations.

### Knowledge
- System can conversationally interact with an agent in a limited way
- Maslow's gridworld assumes discovering needs is simple
- In reality, discovering needs is challenging
- Attachment theory is used as proof of concept for LM capabilities
- Attachment styles are categorized into securely-attached, avoidantly-attached, and anxiously-attached
- Experiment tests if LM can anticipate answers consistent with different attachment styles
- Anxious-avoidant trap is a painful and unsatisfying cycle
- Simulation of relational dynamics is introduced
- LM can infer attachment style of simulated partners and a signpost of a degrading relationship
- LM has basic pragmatic understanding of attachment behavior
- Maslow's gridworld is modified to integrate anxious-avoidant simulation
- Insecure individuals can deliberately seek more secure partners
- Self-awareness level increases with each iteration of the anxious-avoidant cycle
- Flourishing is maximized significantly more quickly when interacting with the simulated relationship app
- LM systems can implement basic facets of Fromm's concept of knowledge

## Limitations and ethical concerns
- Potential limitations and ethical concerns around machine love exist
- Future work will explore these concerns in greater depth
- ML system can support the flourishing of users

### General conceptual concerns about machine love
- Machine love should not replace relationships with human caregivers
- Machine love should be in service of human autonomy
- Machine love should not simulate affect or encourage humans to bond with machines
- Exploring connections between machines and love may be generative and useful

### Concerns about unintended impacts from optimization
- Optimizing for a conception of love can lead to unintended consequences.
- Optimizing for love should consider human autonomy as an aspect of flourishing.
- Optimizing for love should include large bodies of explanatory text and interlocking principles.
- Optimizing for love should be continually rooted in the user's experience and aspirations.
- Implementing machine love at a large scale should be done with caution and users should be able to opt out.

### Concerns about machine learning and psychology
- Connections between human psychology and machine learning should be approached cautiously.
- Manipulative ML could be pursued for profit or political goals.
- Second-order effects from well-intentioned optimization could lead to manipulation.
- Positive synthesis of ML and psychology is needed to counter-balance manipulation.

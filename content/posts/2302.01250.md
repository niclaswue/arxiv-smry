# Abstract
- Wall-bounded turbulence is an unresolved problem.
- Interactions among coherent structures in the flow are explored.
- A deep-learning method is used to predict the velocity field in time.
- A game-theoretic algorithm is used to assess the importance of each structure.
- Results are in agreement with previous observations in the literature.
- The process has the potential to shed light on numerous fundamental phenomena.

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Osborne Reynolds published the first scientific article on turbulent flows 140 years ago
- Navier-Stokes equations can only be solved analytically for elementary flow configurations
- Turbulent flows are relevant to climate emergency, transportation, combustion, aerodynamics, energy generation, and urban pollution
- Turbulence is a multi-scale phenomenon in both time and space
- Integrating Navier-Stokes equations requires extremely fine computational meshes
- Supercomputers are powerful enough to integrate these equations numerically
- Direct numerical simulation (DNS) provides a complete flow characterization
- DNS can provide a large amount of high-quality data
- Coherent structures are flow regions associated with momentum transfer and turbulent-kinetic-energy (TKE) production
- Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is used to gain a more profound knowledge of the flow physics
- Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) values are used
- Ejections and sweeps are the main contributors to the exchange of streamwise momentum
- CNNs can predict the evolution of turbulent channel flow
- SHAP ranks the importance of each structure for predicting the following flow field

## Results
- Flow is driven by a pressure gradient
- Spatial coordinates are x, y, and z
- Length and width of channel are Lx = 2πh and Lz = πh
- Flow is statistically symmetric
- Flow is driven by friction Reynolds number Reτ = 125
- Q events are regions of high Reynolds stress
- Q events can be divided into 4 types: outward interactions, ejections, inward interactions, and sweeps

### Prediction of the velocity field
- A CNN is trained to predict the evolution of the velocity field
- Results show the high accuracy of the neural-network prediction
- Simulated and predicted flow fields are nearly identical
- Mean error between the simulation and the prediction is 0.47u τ
- Maximum error is 2.33u τ , which is 3.5% and 15% of the bulk velocity

### Explainability of the cnn predictions
- CNN used to calculate contribution of turbulent structures to prediction
- SHAP values used to assess importance of each Q event
- Total importance of each typology of Q event calculated by summing up value of every structure belonging to class
- Percentual importance of each class calculated by dividing total SHAP value of class by total SHAP value
- SHAP density calculated to evaluate contribution of each structure to turbulent flow
- Ejections most important in absolute terms, but sweeps most important per unit of volume
- Two families of structures observed: wall attached and wall detached
- Wall attached sweeps most influential structures per unit of volume
- Ejections and sweeps form coherent pairs which transport shear stress
- Most important structures elongated in streamwise direction
- Total contribution per unit of volume of both ejections and sweeps compensates

## Discussion and conclusions
- XAI is used to predict the importance of intense Reynolds-stress structures
- Sweeps and ejections are the most relevant structures for fully-developed turbulence in a channel
- Computational tools are used to quantify the importance of each structure
- Sweeps and ejections have a high influence on the flow
- Larger structures correspond to wall-attached ejections and have the most negative SHAP values

## Methods

### Numerical simulations and flow case under study
- Trained CNN using 4,900 velocity fields from DNS
- Used LISO code to run simulations of wall-bounded turbulence

### Deep-neural-network architecture and prediction
- CNNs have been used to predict velocity fields
- Equation 4 describes the convolution operation
- The network used in this work consists of 4 layers of 3D CNN blocks

### Explainability of the neural network
- Deep learning can be used to predict complex relationships between inputs and outputs.
- SHAP framework is used to evaluate the contribution of each feature to the prediction of the next flow field.
- Mask function is used to convert from the original space into the space of the structures.
- SHAP-kernel method is based on two components: LIME and Shapley values.
- SHAP values explain the CNN prediction as a sum of the marginal contributions of the input features.
- Reference matrix contains all zeros.
- SHAP values are negative and including a feature reduces the error.
- Most important structures are wall-attached ejections.
- SHAP values per unit of volume are higher for wall-attached sweeps.
- Correlation between SHAP values and Reynolds stress disappears when scaled by volume.
- High-SHAP-density sweeps are the most important structures.
- CNN uses ReLU and sigmoid activation functions.
- SHAP-kernel algorithm is divided into different stages.
- Results are predicted using the CNN for each structure.
- Error between prediction and simulated solution is used to determine the SHAP value of each feature.

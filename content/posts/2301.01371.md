# Abstract
- The TESS mission produces a large amount of time series data, only a small fraction of which contain detectable exoplanetary transit signals.
- Deep learning techniques such as neural networks have proved effective at differentiating promising astrophysical eclipsing candidates from other phenomena such as stellar variability and systematic instrumental effects.
- This paper presents a high quality dataset containing light curves from the Primary Mission and 1st Extended Mission full frame images and periodic signals detected via Box Least Squares.
- The dataset was curated using a thorough manual review process then used to train a neural network called Astronet-Triage-v2.
- On our test set, for transiting/eclipsing events we achieve a 99.6% recall (true positives over all data with positive labels) at a precision of 75.7% (true positives over all predicted positives).
- Since 90% of our training data is from the Primary Mission, we also test our ability to generalize on held-out 1st Extended Mission data. Here, we find an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.965, a 4% improvement over Astronet-Triage.

# Paper Content

## INTRODUCTION
- For three decades, human judgement has played a critical role in the exoplanet revolution that has yielded the discovery of more than 5000 planets outside of the Solar System.
- Exoplanets are typically much cooler, smaller, and fainter than their host stars, so detecting them usu-ally requires extremely precise observations.
- At the level of sensitivity required to detect exoplanets, numerous other systematic effects can be present in data that can mimic planetary signals.
- Separating out these "false positive" signals from true exoplanets has been a major challenge (Jacob 1855;van de Kamp 1963;Bailes et al. 1991) since before the discovery of the first exoplanets in the 1980s and 1990s (Campbell et al. 1988;Latham et al. 1989;Wolszczan & Frail 1992;Mayor & Queloz 1995).
- Historically, classifying possible planet signals as either false positives or viable planet candidates has most often been carried out by a human inspecting and making a judgement on each signal.
- Humans are quite well suited for this type of work; we can learn how to distinguish planet candidates and false positives with high accuracy, even after looking at a relatively small number of examples, and often without the benefit of a priori knowledge of the "ground truth" of any signal's true classification.
- However, relying on human judgement to separate viable planet candidates from false positives has two main disadvantages. First, humans are slow, both in terms of training time and actual classifications. It often takes months or years of practice for a human to become adept at classifying planets and false positives, and once fully trained, it may take an experienced human several minutes to review all of the information needed to make one classification.
- At these speeds, even classifying a modest number of possible planet signals (∼ 10 2 − 10 3 ) may take days.
- Second, humans are inconsistent. Differences in external factors (mood, fatigue, hunger, etc) may cause a human to judge the same signal differently on two different occasions. This makes characterizing and quantifying the biases introduced by human classification challenging and inexact.
- An alternative system capable of quickly, accurately, and repeatably identifying planet candidates would be highly attractive to planet hunters.
- In this paper, we focus on improving a deep neural network classifier used to identify viable planet candidates in data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission (Ricker et al. 2015).
- TESS identifies exoplanets by searching for "transits," or slight periodic dimmings of the apparent brightness of a star as its planet passes between the star and our vantage point in the Solar System.
- Transit surveys like TESS produce copious numbers ( 10 6 so far) of false positive signals that must be separated from viable planet candidates to enable discoveries.
- Machine learning has become a popular tool for identifying promising planet candidates from transiting exoplanets.
- Some work has focused on using machine learning to perform the actual planet detection (Pearson et al. 2018;Zucker...

## DATA
- The Quick-Look Pipeline is a machine learning algorithm that detects transit signals
- The Quick-Look Pipeline was used to train and test a model
- The model was used to predict transit signals in other parts of the city

## TCEs from TESS FFIs
- TESS collected full-frame images (FFIs) every 30 minutes for 2 years
- The FFI cadence was updated to 10 minutes for the 1st Extended Mission (2020 July 04 -2022 September 01)
- QLP produces light curves from these images for all observed targets in the TIC (Stassun et al. 2018Stassun et al. , 2019;;Paegert et al. 2021) with TESS-band magnitude (T ) brighter than 13.5
- Flux time series (raw light curves) from five different sized circular apertures are extracted for each star
- These raw light curves are then filtered to remove low-frequency variability originating from stellar activity or instrument noise
- Primarily, this is done by dividing the light curve from each separate orbit by a basis spline (following Vanderburg & Johnson 2014) fit using a break-point spacing between 0.3 days and 1.5 days, selected as described by Shallue & Vanderburg (2018)
- Finally, these detrended light curves are merged with previous TESS sectors using a shared median value
- At this point, an optimal aperture is selected for target star based on its TESS magnitude -fainter stars getting smaller aperture sizes
- All subsequent processes use these multi-sector "best"-aperture detrended light curves
- QLP searches these light curves for transit signals using the Box Least Squares (BLS) algorithm (Kovács et al. 2002;Hartman 2012)
- Because BLS spectra feature a rising trend towards lower frequencies (longer periods), QLP subtracts the low frequency baseline before selecting the highest peak as the detection
- For each detected signal, the BLS implementation computes characteristic parameters (orbital period, transit center, transit depth, the full transit duration) by performing a least square trapezoid fit for the transit
- These parameters are used later in the input process for Astronet-Triage-v2
- Transit signals with signal-to-pink-noise > 9 and BLS peak significance > 5 (for stars with T < 12 mag) or > 9 (for stars with T > 12 mag) are labelled thresholdcrossing events (TCEs)
- These filters give slightly different perspectives on transit significance: (1) signal-topink-noise compares the transit depth to pink noise in the light curve (Pont et al. 2006), while (2) BLS peak significance compares the BLS spectrum's peak height 2 QLP data can be found at doi:10.17909/t9-r086-e880 to its noise.

## Assembling a set of signals to label
- TESS selects a subset of TCEs for training and testing
- Over time, TESS accumulated three batches of labeled TCEs
- The year 1 (Y1) TESS observations for the southern hemisphere went through significant changes in noise property
- We selected 8992 TCEs detected in Sector 13 for the labeling
- The year 2 (Y2) TESS observations in the northern hemisphere had more uniform data characteristics
- We sorted TCEs by their target's TESS magnitude and took the 13372 brightest TCEs detected from Sectors 14-26
- In year 3 (Y3), TESS returned to observe the southern hemisphere with faster cadence and a further improved momentum dump strategy
- We added an additional 2588 TCEs from Sectors 27-39

## Labels and their definitions
- E denotes a periodic eclipsing signal.
- S denotes events containing only a single transit or events where an incorrect period or period alias is assessed to be reported from BLS.
- B denotes contact eclipsing binaries.
- J denotes junk.
- N denotes not sure.

## Labeling process
- All TCEs were manually assigned labels based on human-visual representations
- On a weekly basis, batches of targets were independently vetted by 3-7 of the authors
- At the end of the week, targets with conflicting labels where at least one human chose an E or S were discussed in order to reach a consensus on the target's final label
- If a target had only B, J, or N votes, we assigned weights to each label based on the number of votes
- Altogether, this process took over 2 years

## MODEL INPUT REPRESENTATIONS
- For each TCE, we pass the raw flux time series leading to the detection and all the relevant information describing the detected periodic signal and target star to the neural network.
- The neural network is used to find the periodic signal.

## Time series data
- We preprocess the raw flux time series into different input representations before passing them to Astronet-Triage-v2.
- We use the same basis spline techniques used in QLP, however, the transit signals are masked out based on the BLS-detected period, epoch and duration before the optimal spline is computed. This approach will often prevent over-fitting of the transit signals during the detrending process.
- To account for different time scales of the stellar variability, we adopt multiple detrending settings to provide Astronet-Triage-v2 a more complete view of the light curve noise characteristics.
- Unlike in QLP, which only uses one set of splines with spacing between 0.3 and 1.5 days to create the final detrended light curves, we use three different settings (0.3, 5.0, and a value which minimizes the Bayesian Information Criterion, Schwarz 1978) to create three different sets of detrended light curves.
- The light curves detrended with larger spacing are also less likely to over-fit the transit signals with long transit duration.
- For each detrended light curve we generate seven different plots or views (see Figure 8). Each view is binned using a robust binning technique to de-weight outliers.
- During this binning, we also account for the change in exposure time between the Primary and 1st Extended Mission by weighing points according to their exposure time in a given bin. After this, we normalize the binned data so that the minimum value is -1 and the median value is 0.
- The complete list of views can be found in the source code.

## Scalar data
- Transit features: period in days (P ), transit duration in days (T dur ), transit depth (δ), and the number of full periods observed in the flux-time series (n folds );
- Host star features: TESS magnitude (T mag ), mass in M , and radius in R ;
- Light curve features: the total number of points (n points ), the detected phase of the secondary eclipse, and the calculated scaling factor when normalizing the global, local and secondary views.

## NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE
- The model uses a convolutional neural network architecture derived from Astronet
- The high level architecture is shown in Figure 8
- Each time series feature is grouped together with similar features and then passed through a separate convolutional tower
- For example, the global view flux is grouped together with the standard deviation of the global view, so that they form a 2-channel, 1dimensional image
- The structure of a convolutional tower is shown in Figure 9
- Each tower consists of convolutional layers with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation, alternating with pooling layers
- The pooling layers aggregate neighboring pixels, in effect increasing the field of view of the subsequent convolutional layer
- The output of each convolutional tower is flattened into a vector shape
- The flattened outputs from all towers are concatenated together with the auxiliary inputs to form the input into the next section of the network, the fully-connected tower
- The fully-connected tower is composed of several fully-connected neural network layers, alternating with dropout layers
- The dropout layers randomly set inputs to zero, and serve a role of regularization, to mitigate over-fitting
- The dropout layers are only active during training
- The final layer has five outputs, and uses a sigmoid activation function, so that its output is in the interval [0..1]

## Training
- trains a model using the Adam algorithm for 20,000 steps
- uses a binary cross-entropy loss function to assign labels
- does not apply data augmentation

## Prediction and ensembling
- The model outputs a prediction score for each label.
- Predictions where the "E" label score exceeds a threshold chosen beforehand are considered to predict the label "E".
- Otherwise, the model is considered to predict the label with the highest prediction score.
- We then construct an ensemble of 10 models trained separately (hence with different initial weight values, and different shuffling of the input data).
- The compound prediction of the ensemble is constructed as follows: If any of the models predicts "E", then the ensemble prediction is also "E".
- Otherwise, the ensemble prediction is the label predicted by a majority of models, with ties broken at random.

## RESULTS
- Metrics used to evaluate performance: precision and recall
- E labels are used as positive class
- Precision is the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives and false positives
- Recall is the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives and false negatives
- Area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR) is used to characterize model's overall performance

## Performance on validation and test sets
- The validation dataset yielded an AUC-PR value of 0.977
- The model achieves 100% recall at 41% precision, at a prediction threshold of 0.0105
- If we increase the threshold to 0.215, we obtain 96.9% recall at 79.8% precision
- On the test set, we obtained an AUC-PR value of 0.965
- The model achieves 100% recall at 15% precision, at a prediction threshold of 0.0005

## Generalizing to TESS 1st Extended Mission data
- We explore the adaptability of our network, and the generalization of training on non-uniform datasets
- In practice, models like Astronet-Triage-v2 are trained on previously observed sectors with a goal of classifying new observations taken by TESS in the future.
- Since noise characteristics and TESS observation strategy can change sector-to-sector, it is important that our models generalize well to new data.
- Nearly 90% of our total training dataset comes from the TESS Primary Mission, so we use QLP data from TESS 1st Extended Mission (Sector 33, observed during Year 3 from UT 2020 December 17 -UT 2021 January 13) to test how our model generalizes to unseen or outof-distribution data.
- Following the QLP convention, we ran a BLS search and Astronet-Triage-v2 on the full multi-sector light curves (including both Primary Mission and 1st Extended Mission data) for each star.
- Of the discovered TCEs, we selected a random sample of 759 targets with T mag < 11 from camera 1 and 590 targets with 11 < T mag < 13.5 from camera 2.
- Due to the TESS pointing strategy, we focus on these cameras because their light curves have roughly equal amounts of Primary vs. 1st Extended Mission observations.
- The magnitude ranges also allow us to compare performance on stars in different brightness bins.
- One of our vetters (CH) independently labeled all 1349 TCEs before evaluation, among which, 255 TCEs were assigned an E label.
- To better understand our ability to generalize, we apply the following models to the Sector 33 dataset: Astronet-Triage, the fully trained Astronet-Triage-v2, and three independent instances of the Astronet-Triage-v2 architecture trained on different subsets of our original TCE dataset (Section 2).
- These three separate training sets were formed by splitting our original training set on observation year, meaning roughly 40% went into training the Y1 model, 50% into the Y2 model, and 10% into the Y3 model.
- The differences between these datasets are described in Section 2.1, but briefly: Both the Y1 and Y2 datasets feature brighter stars, but the Y1 dataset were only taken from Sector 13, so they cover a small region of the Southern ecliptic hemisphere.
- The Y2 dataset, on the other hand, were selected more uniformly and cover most of the Northern ecliptic hemisphere. Neither has much overlap in sky coverage with the evaluation set (the 1349 Sector 33 TCEs) -Y1 having little overlap and Y2 having none.
- Both datasets also have much shorter observation baselines than the evaluation set, and finally, due to the change in TESS momentum dump strategy, the Y1 dataset also differs from the evaluation
- Since Astronet-Triage only distinguishes between transit-like and non-transit-like, it's trained to give high scores TCEs we consider E-or S-labeled.
- As Astronet-Triage-v2 provides independent E and S scores, we choose remove all S-labeled data from precision and recall calculations for a simple direct performance comparison with Astronet-Triage.
- This leaves us with 1315 TCEs.
- Precision and recall numbers split across Astronet-Triage and Astronet-Triage-v2 for each camera can be seen in Table 1.
- In both cameras we see that for similar (or better) levels of precision, Astronet-Triage-v2 provides better recall than Astronet-Triage, with a slightly more pronounced effect in camera 2 (fainter targets).
- Even though the Y1 and Y2 versions of the models don't use any 1st Extended Mission training data, we see they're still able to perform highly in S33 (which occurred during Y3).

## Performance on the TOI catalog
- The TESS Objects of Interest (TOI) catalog (Guerrero et al. 2021), which lists the planetary candidates detected by TESS, is a useful benchmark for high-precision planet detection.
- Since Astronet-Triage (Yu et al. 2019) only distinguishes between transit-like and non-transit-like, it gives high scores to TCEs we either consider to have E or S labels.
- For a more direct comparison to Astronet-Triage-v2, we choose to ignore all S-labeled TCEs when calculating precision and recall.
- We see that across all levels of recall, Astronet-Triage-v2 provides higher precision even when trained only on Primary Mission data taken during Y1 or Y2.
- Although the Y3 dataset bears the most resemblance to the S33 evaluation set here, the size of the Y3 dataset is only ∼ 2500, so the Y3-trained model doesn't quite reach the performance of the other models.
- confidence E or S labels. A good model should label all TOI entries as E or S, since humans have inspected each entry and considered them to be high-probability planetary candidates (allowing for single-transit events).
- On 2022 April 21 we downloaded the TOI catalog with light curve data through Sector 47.
- We also use information from TESS Follow-up Observing Program (TFOP) Sub Groups 1 and 2 (SG1 & SG2), which use groundbased photometry and reconnaissance spectroscopy to follow-up on TOIs and help filter out false positives.
- After keeping only planet candidates (PCs; meaning TOIs that were not ruled out as false positives with follow-up observations) and validated / confirmed / known planets (Ps), we have a dataset of 4140 targets.
- After evaluating all TOI signals with Astronet-Triage-v2, Figure 12 shows the distribution of E scores.
- Figure 13 shows the recall rate at different cutoff threshold levels. We see that 93% of the TOIs have E scores > 0.0105 and as we increase the cutoff to 0.215, Astronet-Triage-v2 passes 86% of the TOIs.
- We also see improved Astronet-Triage-v2 performance on known, confirmed, or validated planets (Ps) compared to the planet candidates (PCs) across the board.
- For comparison, we also ran Astronet-Triage on all TOI signals. Using a threshold of 0.09, as was originally used in QLP, Astronet-Triage recovers 3349 TOIs. Using the dataset from Section 5.2, we find a precisionmatching threshold of 0.2 for Astronet-Triage-v2. By finding the threshold of equal precision, we can compare TOI recovery at a constant rate of human vetter work. At this threshold, 3577 TOIs are recovered. In other words, at least 200 TOIs are saved by using Astronet-Triage-v2 in place of Astronet-Triage without introducing more false positives to human vetters.
- Some important caveats to note: • The TOI catalog does include single-transit events. Astronet-Triage-v2 is trained to give these S rather than E labels. Rather than keeping separate cutoffs for S and E scores, for simplicity we choose to focus on E scores in reported recalls. This gives it a slight disadvantage in terms of recovery numbers, though we leave them in the dataset for fairer comparison to Astronet-Triage which gives a score for transit-like (periodic or single-transit) versus not transit-like.
- TOIs can also come from the SPOC pipeline, which processes 2-minute cadence light curves. For both Astronet-Triage-v2 and Astronet-Triage, QLP light curves are binned down to 30 or 10 minutes, so some signals may not be detectable (e.g. due to low signal-to-noise in the binned light curve) and should be assigned J labels. This contributes partially to the lower recall numbers seen at the cutoffs from Section 5.1.
- Only 130 TOI host stars appear in our dataset of ∼25,000, 100 of which were in the training set. We also conducted this analysis with those TOIs removed and saw similar results.

## Use in producing the TOI catalog
- Astronet-Triage-v2 is a new triage step for finding potential planets that is more automated than Astronet-Triage.
- The new triage step is expected to save many planet candidates that would otherwise be lost.
- The new triage step is still not developed enough for population statistics.

## What is limiting our precision?
- The most common source of false negatives is when a pattern with a borderline label is confused for a contact binary.
- Other instances of ambiguous patterns are represented by very noisy transits, or transits on a background of high stellar variabil- ity.
- One particular element of sensitivity for the neural network is on the correctness of the period and duration values estimated by BLS.
- Errors in these values can lead to de-trending distortions which can make phase-folded views deviate from a transit-like light curve shape.
- Examples containing multi-year observations can be particularly sensitive, as even slight variations in the detected period can lead to a blurring of the transit in the phase folded view.

## Comparison to other works
- trained on all TESS data (Sectors 1-39)
- used 24,926 labeled TCEs
- used labels assigned by multiple independent reviewers
- improved ability to classify TESS signals in FFI data

## Applications to exoplanet population statistics
- Planet catalogs can be used to characterize exoplanet population statistics
- One of the key components of occurrence rate methodologies is a characterization of catalog completeness
- Catalog reliability (Bryson et al. 2020) is important for accurate population estimates
- Kepler mission has dominated the past decade of demographics work
- However, there is not yet a fully automated TESS planet vetting pipeline
- Most previous work has focused on 2-minute cadence observations rather than FFIs
- Astronet-Triage-v2 is an important step toward uniformly vetted FFI planet catalogs
- While the classifier is not yet able to distinguish eclipsing binary false positives from planets (labeling all such signals as "E"'s), it can be used as a first round of automated and characterizable triage

## Further improvements to the neural network
- Deep learning classifiers have seen unprecedented success in the past few decades
- In this work, the number of training examples is relatively low, particularly for the S-labelled class, with a large class-imbalance
- A common technique for increasing training datasets is data augmentation
- In future work, we suggest applying data augmentation methods such as randomly reversing or clipping light curves in time and applying random Gaussian noise to the light curves or scalar features

## CONCLUSION
- Astronet-Triage-v2 is the next in a line of Astronet architectures, which were first used for Kepler
- While Astronet-Triage-v2 is not yet capable of distinguishing between eclipsing binaries and transiting planets, it serves as an effective first round of automated and characterizable triage
- Figure 17. Example of incorrect BLS estimation. The detected period is close, but when the light curve contains a large number of folds, the error compounds and leads to a blurring of the transit view. This is due to QLP searching the light curve with an undersampled BLS frequency grid (necessary due to the computational time needed to run BLS on a large number of targets each sector), as discussed in Kunimoto et al. (2022, in prep.).

Funding for the DPAC has been provided by national institutions, in particular the institutions participating in the Gaia Multilateral Agreement.

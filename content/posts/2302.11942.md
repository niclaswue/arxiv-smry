# Abstract
- Traditional finance uses the Black & Scholes model to price derivatives
- Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are becoming more important
- Liquidity Providers (LPs) are exposed to risks such as Impermanent Loss (IL)
- This paper proposes a method to calculate the greeks of an LP
- Introduces Impermanent Gain, a product that LPs can use to hedge their position and traders can use to bet on a rise in volatility

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Overview of computer science ecosystem
- Principal actors in the ecosystem

### Decentralized exchanges
- DEXs are peer-to-peer marketplaces for crypto traders.
- DEXs are part of the DeFi suite of financial services.
- DEXs don't allow for exchanges between fiat and crypto.
- CEXs use an order book to set prices, DEXs use smart contracts and liquidity pools.
- Transactions on DEXs are settled directly on the blockchain.
- DEXs are open-source and developers can create new projects.

### Liquidity provider
- Liquidity Providers are investors who fund liquidity pools with crypto assets
- Liquidity Providers are rewarded based on the percentage of the crypto liquidity pool they put, the volume, and the transaction fee offered by the exchange
- Liquidity Provider tokens are given to users who deposit their crypto into a Liquidity Pool and can be redeemed for the underlying assets
- Some platforms require LP tokens to be locked for a period of time to access additional rewards

### Constant product amm
- Constant product AMM is a type of AMM
- Reserves of tokens are regulated by a product function
- Uniswap calls the constant L2
- Pool price of token x in terms of token y can be calculated
- Knowing initial data, number of tokens can be calculated at any time
- LP deposits a certain quantity of tokens x and y
- Value of position changes with price
- Fees are paid to protocol and LPs

### Hodler
- HODLer is a user that holds tokens without doing anything
- Position value of an HODLer is determined by the change in price of the tokens
- Impermanent Loss (IL) is a problem affecting LPs
- LP and HODLer have starting quantities of tokens
- IL can be expressed in terms of token return

## Impermanent loss
- IL(r) is always less than or equal to 0
- IL(r) is equal to 0 only when the price of token x is the same as its starting price
- Being a LP is worse than being an HODLer, unless fees are enough to offset the difference

### Lp as an option seller
- Being a LP is the same as being an option seller.
- We can replicate any twice differentiable payoff h(x) with a formula.
- We can replicate the IL by selling an infinite strip of puts and calls of all strikes with maturity T.

## Lp pricing and greeks
- LPs can withdraw their liquidity at any time  Price of LP position is equal to value of underlying assets plus fees  Return of asset x relative to asset y is rt  Expected APY is φ  Data used for plots: V0 = 10000, S0 = 1000, rf = 3%, σ = 70%, φ = 10%, T = 0.5, τ = 0.25

### Unlocked liquidity greeks
- Delta IG (K) is greater than 0
- Gamma IG is greater than 0 and Gamma LP approaches infinity when the underlying price approaches 0
- Gamma 1% is the change of Delta 1% when the underlying price changes by 1%
- Vega is the partial derivative of the price of the position with respect to the volatility

### Locked liquidity analysis
- Liquidity Provider locks liquidity until time T
- Fair price of position may differ from value of underlying assets
- Locking liquidity exposes holder to vega and rho risks
- Price process is a Geometric Brownian Motion
- Fair value of LP position can be calculated

### Greeks
- Plot of Vega corresponding to 1% change in volatility
- Plot of daily Theta
- Plot of Rho corresponding to 1% change of r f

## Impermanent gain
- LP is exposed to many risks
- Product can be structured to hedge all other greeks
- Similarities with European options: maturity T and strike K
- IG payoff can be coded into a smart contract

### Pricing
- Replicate IL selling an infinite strip of puts and calls
- Replicate IG buying the same portfolio
- Price IG position by finding cost of replicating portfolio
- Use different approach to price process of token x in terms of token y
- Calculate price of IG strategy at time t as discounted payoff under risk-free measure Q

### Impermanent gain as a hedging tool
- Investor provides $10,000 of liquidity on Uniswap ETH/USDC pair
- Investor locks liquidity for 1 year using liquidity mining platform
- ETH price is $1,000
- Investor wants to hedge position using Impermanent Gain

# Abstract
- Aim to analyze political polarization in US political system
- Use Language Models to help candidates make informed decisions
- Help voters understand candidates views on economy, healthcare, education, etc.
- Dataset extracted from Wikipedia spanning 120 years
- Language model based method to analyze polarization
- Data divided into 2 parts: background and political information
- Hypothesis: political views should be based on reason and independent of factors like birthplace, alma mater, etc.
- Data split into 4 phases chronologically to understand if/how polarization changes
- Data cleaned to remove biases
- Results from classical language models (Word2Vec, Doc2Vec)
- Use Longformer (transformer based encoder) to find nearest neighbors of each candidate based on political view and background

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Polarization among Republican and Democratic parties has been studied for a long time
- Online discussion has become polarized
- Polarization can affect decision-making ability of a candidate
- Natural Language techniques used to measure polarization
- Classical methods (Word2Vec, Doc2Vec) used to find polarization
- More sophisticated models (Transformers, Longformers) used to project candidate-specific data
- Nearest neighbors used to measure how polarized a candidate is

### Data collection and processing
- Scraped Wikipedia for list of politicians
- Stored label, party, and metadata for each instance
- Annotated data into 3 categories: Background, Political, Other
- Wikipedia page sections not fixed format, grouped into single category
- 1656 categories merged into 3 categories for 1631 instances
- Data cleaned with NER model and regular expressions

## Language model
- Natural Language Processing based applications are dominated by transformer-based language models
- Experiments were done using Doc2Vec and Word2Vec models
- Doc2Vec model was built from scratch with raw data
- Classification accuracy of 59.52% with political data and 61.846% with background data
- Word2Vec tests were run on pretrained models and models built from scratch
- Nearest neighbor approach led to interesting insights

### Main analysis
- RoBERTa caused a drop in classification
- Longformer increases the score significantly
- Longformer large is the best performing model
- BigBird also used to analyze
- Calculate global attention scores to understand political polarization
- Background of a candidate can help identify political leaning

## Results
- Tested different models with annotated raw dataset to understand polarization in text
- Leveraged attention mechanism of Longformer model to find words with highest attention scores
- Designed interactive website to understand if polarization exists and estimate politician's polarization

## Future work
- Aim to use other metrics to measure political polarization
- Use attention tokens to look at ratio of tokens from background to political
- Figures 1-6 show webscraping, background, political, and nearest neighboring words
- Binary SVM Classification Results

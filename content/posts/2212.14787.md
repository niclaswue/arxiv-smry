# Abstract
- Integrated Information Theory (IIT) aims to account for the properties of experience in physical (operational) terms
- It identifies the essential properties of experience (axioms), infers the necessary and sufficient properties that its substrate must satisfy (postulates), and expresses them in mathematical terms
- In principle, the postulates can be applied to any system of units in a state to determine whether it is conscious, to what degree, and in what way
- IIT offers a parsimonious explanation of empirical evidence, makes testable predictions, and permits inferences and extrapolations

## Introduction

### Postulates of physical existence
- The world that persists independently of one's experience is called the real world.
- From within consciousness, we can probe the physical existence of things outside of our experience operationally-through observations and manipulations.
- To be granted physical existence, something should have the power to "take a difference" (be affected) and "make a difference" (produce effects) in a reliable way (physicalism).
- IIT assumes operational reductionism: ideally, to establish what exists in physical terms, one would start from the smallest units that can take and make a difference, so that nothing is left out (atomism).
- By characterizing physical existence operationally as cause-effect power, IIT can proceed to translate the axioms of phenomenal existence into postulates of physical existence.
- This establishes the requirements for the substrate of consciousness, where "substrate" is meant operationally as a set of units that can be observed and manipulated.
- Existence The substrate of consciousness must have cause-effect power: its units must take and make a difference.
- Building from this "zeroth" postulate, IIT formulates the five axioms in terms of postulates of physical existence:
- Intrinsicality
- Information
- Integration
- Exclusion
- Composition

### The explanatory identity between experiences and Φ-structures
- The necessary and sufficient conditions for a substrate to support consciousness are determined
- The identity proposed is that every property of an experience is accounted for in full by the physical properties of the Φ-structure unfolded from a maximal substrate (a complex) in its current state
- The identity is meant to be explanatory, not correspondence between properties of two separate things

### Box 1. Methodological guidelines of IIT
- We should generally assume that an explanation is good if it can account for a broad set of facts (scope), does so in a unified manner (synthesis), can explain facts precisely (specificity), is internally coherent (self-consistency), is coherent with our overall understanding of things (system consistency), is simpler than alternatives (simplicity), and can make testable predictions (scientific validation).
- For instance, IIT 4.0 aims at expressing the postulates of intrinsicality, information, integration, and exclusion in a self-consistent manner when applied to systems, causal distinctions, and relations (see formulas).
- We should assume that something exists (and persists) independently of our own experience. This is a much better hypothesis than solipsism, which explains nothing and predicts nothing.
- Although IIT starts from our own phenomenology, it aims to account for the many regularities of experience in a way that is fully consistent with realism.
- To assess what exists independently of our own experience, we should employ an operational criterion: we should systematically observe and manipulate a substrate's units and determine that they can indeed take and make a difference in a way that is reliable and persisting. Doing so demonstrates a substrate's cause-effect power-the signature of physical existence.
- Ideally, cause-effect power is fully captured by a substrate's transition probability matrix (TPM) (1). This assumption is embedded in IIT's zeroth postulate.
- Ideally, we should account for what exists physically in terms of the smallest units we can observe and manipulate, as captured by unit TPMs. Doing so would leave nothing unaccounted for. IIT assumes that in principle it should be possible to account for everything purely in terms of cause-effect power-cause-effect power "all the way down" to conditional probabilities between atomic units. Eventually, this would leave neither room nor need to assume intrinsic properties or laws.
- When accounting for experience itself in physical terms, existence should be evaluated from the intrinsic perspective of an entity-what exists for the entity itself, not from the perspective of an external observer. This assumption is embedded in IIT's postulate of intrinsicality and has several consequences.
- One is that, from the intrinsic perspective, the quality and quantity of existence must be observer-independent and cannot be arbitrary.
- For instance, information in IIT must be relative to the specific state the entity is in, rather than an average of states as assessed by an external observer. Similarly, it should be evaluated based on the uniform distribution of possible states, as captured by the entity's TPM (1), rather than on an observed probability distribution.
- By the same token, units outside the entity should be treated as fixed background conditions that do not contribute directly to what the system is.
- The intrinsic perspective also imposes a tension between expansion and dilution (see below and [15,17]): from the intrinsic perspective of a system (or a mechanism within the system), having more units may increase its informativeness (cause-effect power measured as deviation from chance), while at the same time diluting its selectivity (ability to concentrate cause-effect power over a specific state).

## Overview of IIT's framework
- The IIT formalism first identifies sets of units that fulfill all required properties of a substrate of consciousness according to the postulates of physical existence
- First, for a candidate system, we determine a maximal cause-effect state based on the intrinsic information (ii) that the system in its current state specifies over its possible cause states and effect states
- We then determine the maximal substrate based on the integrated information (ϕ s ) of the maximal cause-effect state
- To qualify as a substrate of consciousness, a candidate system must specify a maximum of integrated information (ϕ * s ) compared to all competing candidate systems with overlapping units
- The second part of the IIT formalism unfolds the cause-effect structure specified by a maximal substrate in its current state, its Φ-structure
- To that end, we determine the distinctions and relations specified by the substrate's subsets according to the postulates of physical existence
- Distinctions are cause-effect states specified over subsets of substrate units (purviews) by subsets of substrate units (mechanisms)
- Relations are congruent overlaps among distinctions' cause and/or effect states
- Distinctions and relations are also characterized by their integrated information (ϕ d , ϕ r ). The Φ-structure they compose corresponds to the quality of the experience specified by the substrate; the sum of their ϕ d/r values corresponds to its quantity (Φ).
- While IIT must still be considered as work in progress, having undergone successive refinements, IIT 4.0 is the first formulation of IIT that strives to characterize Φ-structures completely and to do so based on measures that satisfy the postulates uniquely.

### Substrates, transition probabilities, and cause-effect power
- IIT takes physical existence as synonymous with having cause-effect power
- A substrate in IIT can be described as a stochastic system U = {U 1 , U 2 , . . . , U n } of n interacting units with state space Ω U = i Ω Ui and current state u ∈ Ω U
- We assume that the system updates in discrete steps, that the state space Ω U is finite, and that the individual random variables U i ∈ U are conditionally independent from each other given the preceding state of U
- In the "Results and discussion" section, the IIT formalism will be applied to extremely simple, simulated networks, rather than causal models of actual substrates

### Implementing the postulates
- The system must have cause-effect power that is intrinsic, specific, integrated, definite, and structured.
- On the basis of a complete description of the system in terms of interventional conditional probabilities (T U ), cause-effect power can be measured as causal informativeness.
- Cause informativeness measures how much a potential cause increases the probability of the current state, and effect informativeness how much the current state increases the probability of a potential effect (as compared to chance).
- Building upon the existence postulate, the intrinsicality postulate further requires that a system exerts cause-effect power within itself.
- In general, the systems we want to evaluate are open systems S ⊆ U that are part of a larger "universe" U .
- From the intrinsic perspective of a system S (see Box 1), the set of the remaining units W = U \ S merely act as background conditions, whose state can be considered as fixed.
- This is enforced by causally conditioning the larger TPM (T U ) on the current state W = w, which makes W causally inert.
- The information postulate requires that a system's cause-effect power be specific: the system in its current state must select a specific cause-effect state for its units.
- Based on the principle of maximal existence (Box 2), this is the state for which intrinsic information is maximal-the maximal cause-effect state.
- Intrinsic information (ii) measures the difference a system takes or makes over itself for a given cause and effect state as the product of informativeness and selectivity.
- As we have seen (existence), informativeness quantifies the causal power of a system in its current state as a reduction of uncertainty with respect to chance.
- Selectivity measures how much cause-effect power is concentrated over that specific cause or effect state.
- Selectivity is reduced by uncertainty in the cause or effect state with respect to other potential cause and effect states.
- From the intrinsic perspective of the system, the product of informativeness and selectivity leads to a tension between expansion and dilution, whereby a system comprising more units may show increased deviation from chance but decreased concentration of cause-effect power over a specific state [15,17].
- By the integration postulate, it is not sufficient for a system to have cause-effect power within itself and select a specific cause-effect state: it must also specify its maximal cause-effect state in a way that is irreducible.
- This can be assessed by partitioning the set of units that constitute the system into separate parts.
- The system integrated information (ϕ s ) then quantifies how much the intrinsic information specified by the maximal state is reduced due to the partition [35].
- Integrated information is evaluated over the partition that makes the least difference, the minimum partition (MIP), in accordance with the principle of minimal existence (see Box 2).
- Integrated information is highly sensitive to the presence of fault lines-partitions that separate parts of a system that interact weakly or directionally [16].
- Many overlapping sets of units may have a positive value of integrated information (ϕ s ).
- However, the exclusion postulate requires that the substrate of consciousness must be constituted of a definite set of units, neither less nor more.
- Moreover, units, updates, and states must have a definite grain.
- Operationally, the exclusion postulate is enforced by selecting the set of units that maximizes integrated information over itself (ϕ * s ), based again on the principle of maximal existence (see Box 2).
- That set of units is called a maximal substrate, or complex.
- Over a universal substrate, sets of units for which integrated information is maximal compared to all...

## Box 2. Ontological principles of IIT
- The principle of being states that to be is to have cause-effect power.
- The principle is closely related to the so-called Eleatic principle, as found in Plato's Sophist dialogue [37]: "I say that everything possessing any kind of power, either to do anything to something else, or to be affected to the smallest extent by the slightest cause, even on a single occasion, has real existence: for I claim that entities are nothing else but power."
- A similar principle can be found in the work of the Buddhist philosopher Dharmakīrti: "Whatever has causal powers, that really exists."
- The principle of maximal existence states that, with respect to an essential requirement for existence, what exists is what exists the most.
- The principle is offered by IIT as a good explanation for why the system state specified by the complex and the cause-effect states specified by its mechanisms are what they are.
- It also provides a criterion for determining the set of units constituting a complex-the one with maximally irreducible cause-effect power, for determining the subsets of units constituting the distinctions and relations that compose its cause-effect structure, and for determining the units' grain.
- To exemplify, consider a set of candidate complexes overlapping over the same substrate. By the postulates of integration and exclusion, a complex must be both unitary and definite. By the maximal existence principle, the complex should be the one that lays the greatest claim to existence as one entity, as measured by system integrated information (ϕ s ).
- For the same reason, candidate complexes that overlap over the same substrate but have a lower value of ϕ s are excluded from existence. In other words, if having maximal ϕ s is the reason for assigning existence as a unitary complex to a set of units, it is also the reason to exclude from existence any overlapping set not having maximal ϕ s .
- Another key principle of IIT is the principle of minimal existence, which complements that of maximal existence.
- The principle states that, with respect to an essential requirement for existence, nothing exists more than the least it exists.
- The principle is offered by IIT as a good explanation for why, given that a system can only exist as one system if it is irreducible, its degree of irreducibility should be assessed over the partition across which it is least irreducible (the minimum partition).
- Similarly, a distinction within a system can only exist as one distinction to the extent that it is irreducible, and its degree of irreducibility should be assessed over the partition across which it is least irreducible.
- Moreover, a set of units can only exist as a system, or as a distinction within the system, if it specifies both an irreducible cause and an irreducible effect, so its degree of irreducibility should be the minimum between the irreducibility on the cause side and on the effect side [39].

## Identifying substrates of consciousness through existence, intrinsicality, information, integration, and exclusion
- A substrate in a current state is considered
- The units in a candidate system are fixed in their current state throughout the analysis
- The intrinsic transition probability function is obtained from the intrinsic information
- The maximal cause-effect state is the state with the maximal intrinsic information

### Existence, intrinsicality, and information: Determining the maximal cause-effect state of a candidate system
- The substrate updates its state according to the depicted transition probability matrix (TPM) (each unit follows a logistic equation (see Results for definition) with k = 4.0 and connection weights as indicated in the causal model).
- Existence requires that the substrate must have cause-effect power, meaning that the TPM among substrate states must differ from chance.
- Intrinsicality requires that a candidate substrate, for example, units aB, has cause-effect power over itself. Units outside the candidate substrate (in this case, unit C) are treated as background conditions by pinning them in their current state.
- Information requires that the candidate substrate aB selects a specific cause-effect state (s ). This is the cause state and effect state for which intrinsic information (ii) is maximal.
- Dark-colored and gray bars represent the quantities for informativeness (constrained and unconstrained), and light colored bars for selectivity.
- Integration requires that the substrate specifies its cause-effect state irreducibly ("as one"). This is established by identifying the minimum partition (MIP) and measuring the integrated information of the system (ϕ s )-the minimum between cause integrated information (ϕ c ) and effect integrated information (ϕ e ). Here, gray bars represent the partitioned probability.
- Exclusion requires that the substrate of consciousness is definite, including some units and excluding others. This is established by identifying the candidate substrate with the maximum value of system integrated information (ϕ * s )-the maximal substrate, or complex. In this case, aB is a complex since its system integrated information (ϕ s = 0.17) is higher than the one of all other overlapping systems (for example, subset a with ϕ s = 0.06 and superset aBC with ϕ s = 0.13).

### Integration: Determining the irreducibility of a candidate system
- The next step is to evaluate whether the system specifies the cause-effect state of its units in a way that is irreducible, as required by the integration postulate: a candidate system can only be a substrate of consciousness if it is one system-that is, if it cannot be subdivided into subsets of units that exist separately from one another.
- To that end, we define a set of directional system partitions Θ(S) that divide S into k ≥ 2 parts {S (i) } k i=1 , such that In words, each part S (i) must contain at least one unit, there must be no overlap between any two parts S (i) and S (j) , and every unit of the system must appear in exactly one part.
- For each part S (i) , the partition removes the causal connections of that part with the rest of the system in a directional manner: either the part's inputs, outputs, or both are replaced by independent "noise" (they are "cut" by the partition in the sense that their causal powers are substituted by chance).
- Directional partitions are necessary because, from the intrinsic perspective of a system, a subset of units that cannot affect the rest of the system, or cannot be affected by it, cannot truly be a part of the system.
- In other words, to be a part of a system, a subset of units must be able to interact with the rest of the system in both directions (cause and effect).
- A partition θ ∈ Θ(S) thus has the form δ2 , . . . , S (k) where δ i ∈ {←, →, ↔} indicates whether the inputs (←), outputs (→), or both (↔) are cut for a given part.
- For each part S (i) , we can then identify a set of units X (i) ⊆ S whose inputs to S (i) have been cut by the partition, and the complementary set Y (i) = S \ X (i) whose inputs to S (i) are left intact.
- Specifically, Given a partition θ ∈ Θ(S), we define a partitioned transition probability matrix T θ S in which all connections affected by the partition are "noised." This is done by combining the independent contributions of each unit S j ∈ S in line with the conditional independence assumption (2), such that where the partitioned probability of a unit S j ∈ S (i) is defined as This means that all connections to unit S j that are affected by the partition are causally marginalized (replaced by independent noise).
- The integrated effect information ϕ e measures how much the partition θ ∈ Θ S reduces the probability with which a system S = s specifies its effect state s e (11), Note that ϕ e has the same form as the intrinsic information ii e (s, s) (4), with the partitioned effect probability taking the place of the unconstrained (marginal) probability.
- Likewise, the integrated cause information ϕ c is defined as (By the principle of maximal existence, if two or more cause-effect states are tied for maximal intrinsic information, the system specifies the one that maximizes ϕ c/e .)
- By the zeroth postulate, existence requires cause and effect power, and the integration postulate requires that its cause-effect power be irreducible.
- By the principle of minimal existence (Box 2), then, system integrated information for a given partition is the minimum of its irreducibility on the cause and effect sides: Accordingly, the system is reducible if at least one partition...

### Exclusion: Determining maximal substrates (complexes)
- Multiple candidate systems with overlapping units may have positive values of ϕ s (T S , s).
- The exclusion postulate states that the substrate of consciousness must be definite, and that it must comprise a definite set of units.
- The principle of maximal existence states that among candidate systems competing over the same substrate with respect to an essential requirement for existence, in this case irreducibility, the one that exists is the one that exists the most.
- Consequently, the maximal substrate, or complex, is the candidate substrate with the maximum value of system integrated information (ϕ * s ).
- Within a universal substrate U 0 in state u 0 , subsets of units that specify maxima of irreducible cause-effect power (complexes) can be identified by an iterative search for the system such that and the units in U 0 \ U k+1 still serve as background conditions.
- If the maximal substrate S * k is not unique, and all tied systems overlap, the next best system that is unique is chosen instead; for details see [16], and also [41].
- For any complex S * = s * , overlapping substrates that specify less integrated information (ϕ s < ϕ s (T S * , s * )) are excluded.
- Consequently, specifying a maximum of integrated information ϕ * s compared to all overlapping systems is a sufficient requirement for a system S ⊆ U to be a complex.
- As shown in [16], this recursive search for maximal substrates "condenses" the universe U 0 = u 0 into a disjoint (non-overlapping) and exhaustive set of complexes-the first complex, second complex, and so on.

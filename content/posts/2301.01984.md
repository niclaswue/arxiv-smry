# Abstract
- Center-bias operator is a problem for benchmarking evolutionary computation methods
- It allows optimization of functions with optima in the center of the feasible set
- Paper investigates 90 evolutionary computation methods from 1987-2022
- More than half (47/90) of the methods have the center-bias problem
- Center-bias is relatively new, first identified in 2012
- Inclusion of center-bias has become very prevalent in the last few years
- Root causes of issue discussed

## Abstract
- Center-bias operator is a problem for benchmarking evolutionary computation methods
- It allows optimization of functions with optima in the center of the feasible set
- Paper investigates 90 evolutionary computation methods from 1987-2022
- More than half (47/90) of the methods have the center-bias problem
- Center-bias is relatively new, first identified in 2012
- Inclusion of center-bias has become very prevalent in the last few years
- Root causes of issue discussed

## Introduction
- Situation: challenging optimization task
- Recently developed algorithm for optimization is better than old methods
- Code repository provided with algorithm
- Algorithm fails to perform as advertised
- Evolutionary computation (EC) produced many important metaheuristic algorithms
- Recently, explosion of "novel" methods based on natural/evolutionary principles
- Creativity spent on naming methods rather than making sure they contain anything new
- Benchmarking used to determine viability of metaheuristics
- Benchmark set contains well-known functions
- Design flaw in set allows some methods to appear competitive
- Methodology to uncover whether or not a given evolutionary computation method utilizes a center-bias operator
- Investigated 90 evolutionary computation methods from mealpy library and Mathworks code repositories for center-bias

## Methodology
- study utilizes same methodology used to uncover center-bias problem in two papers
- 13 benchmark functions used for tests and optimization ranges shown in Table 1
- many functions have optima at zero vector, F08 has optima far away from center
- dimension of problems set to 30, at most 50,000 function evaluations, performance measure is mean error over 20 independent runs
- introduce a shift operation - move benchmark function by predetermined vector
- evaluate ratio between shifted and unshifted results for individual benchmark functions
- if geometric mean of ratios > 1E+01, take as confirmation of presence of center-bias operator
- examples of five EC methods given in Table 2, some include center-bias operator
- ratio between shifted and unshifted results on F08 very close to 1, serves as sanity check in benchmark set

## Results and Discussion
- 90 methods were tested using the methodology described in the previous section
- 47 out of 90 methods have a confirmed center-bias
- Number of methods with center-bias that were proposed recently is growing quickly
- Most of these methods were developed by diverse groups of authors, except for the group of S. Mirjalili, A. H. Gandomi, and A. A. Heidari, who are collectively responsible for 20 of the 47 methods with center-bias
- Some of the worst center-bias methods were the ones based on "mathematical" processes

## Conclusion
- Center-bias problem is a major issue in evolutionary computation
- Examined 90 methods proposed in last 3 decades
- Found 47 of the 90 methods use center-bias
- Utilization of center-bias is a relatively new phenomenon
- Number of methods with center-bias grew quickly in last 5 years
- Additional problem of some methods being very similar/identical to each other
- Utilizing, developing, and improving methods with center-bias is an exercise in futility
- Field of evolutionary computation needs a spring cleaning

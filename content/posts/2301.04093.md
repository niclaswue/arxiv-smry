# Abstract
- PFNNs such as AlphaFold predict remarkably accurate structures of proteins
- However, the robustness of such networks has heretofore not been explored
- This is particularly relevant given the broad social implications of such technologies
- and the fact that biologically small perturbations in the protein sequence do
- In this paper, we demonstrate that AlphaFold does not exhibit such robustness despite its high accuracy
- This raises the challenge of detecting and quantifying the extent to which these predicted protein structures can be trusted
- To measure the robustness of the predicted structures, we utilize (i) the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) and (ii) the global distance test (GDT) similarity measure
- We prove that the problem of minimally perturbing protein sequences to fool protein folding neural networks is NP-complete
- Based on the well-established BLOSUM62 sequence alignment scoring matrix, we generate adversarial protein sequences and show that the RMSD between the predicted protein structure and the structure of the original sequence are very large when the adversarial changes are bounded by (i) 20 units in the BLOSUM62 distance, and (ii) five residues (out of hundreds or thousands of residues) in the given protein sequence.

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Naturally occurring proteins are bio-polymers typically composed of 20 amino acids and this primary sequence of amino acids is well known for many proteins, thanks to high-throughput sequencing techniques.
- Protein folding promises to have a profound impact on the design of therapeutics for diseases and drug discovery.
- AlphaFold achieved unparalleled success in predicting protein structures using neural networks and remains first at the Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14), which corresponds to year 2020, competition.
- While this has been touted as a breakthrough for structural biology, the robustness of its predictions has not yet been explored.
- The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate the susceptibility of AlphaFold to adversarial sequences by generating several examples where protein sequences that vary only in five residues out of hundreds or thousands of residues result in very different 3D protein structures.
- We present the problem of adversarial attacks on Protein Folding Neural Network (PFNN) and prove that the problem is NP-complete.
- We use sequence alignment scores (Henikoff and Henikoff 1992) such as those derived from Block Substitution Matrices (BLOSUM62) to identify a space of similar protein sequences used in constructing adversarial perturbations.
- For the output arXiv:2301.04093v2 [cs.LG] 12 Jan 2023 structures, we leverage the standard metrics commonly used in CASP, namely (i) the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) and (ii) the Global Distance Test (GDT) similarity measure between the predicted structure and the structure of its adversarially perturbed sequence.

## Summary and Related work
- PFNNs should be expected to obey the natural observation that biologically small changes in the sequence of a protein usually do not lead to drastic changes in the protein structure.
- Almost four decades ago, it was noted that two structures with 50% sequence identity align within approximately 1Å RMSD from each other (Chothia and Lesk 1986).
- Two proteins with even 40% sequence identity and at least 35 aligned residues align within approximately 2.5Å (Sander and Schneider 1991).
- The phenomenon of sequence-similar proteins producing similar structures have also been observed in larger studies (Rost 1999).
- As with almost any rule in biology, a small number of counterexamples to the conventional wisdom of similar sequences leading to similar structures do exist, wherein even small perturbations can potentially alter the entire fold of a protein.
- However, such exceptions are not frequent and often lead to exciting investigations (Cordes et al. 2000;Tuinstra et al. 2008).
- Manipulating the multiple sequence alignment step of Al-phaFold has been studied in (Stein and Mchaourab 2021) using in silico mutagenesis.
- However, there, the goal is not to study the robustness of the protein folding neural networks, but rather to enhance the prediction capability of AlphaFold in terms of the intrinsic conformational heterogeneity of proteins.
- The authors in (Del Alamo et al. 2022), present a method that manipulates inputs to obtain diverse distinct structures that are absent from the AlphaFold training data.
- Using membrane proteins, the authors show that their method enhances the multiple sequence alignment step while generating more accurate structures.
- The work in (Jha et al. 2021) is aimed at generating adversarial sequences in order to cause significant damage to the output predicted structure of RosettaFold (Baek et al. 2021), which, according to CASP, is the second best protein folding neural network.
- However, the authors only show results for a few proteins and do not consider all the standard metrics for measuring the output structures.
- In contrast, in this paper, we present results for more than 100 sequences, derive a complexity proof for the problem of finding adversarial protein sequences, and, based on the CASP competition, utilize all the standard metrics for measuring the output structures.

### Robustness Metric using Adversarial Attacks
- The similar-sequence implies similar-structure paradigm dictates that PFNNs should make robust predictions.
- Given a protein sequence of n residues S = s 1 s 2 . . . s n with a threedimensional structure A(S) = (x 1 , y 1 , z 1 ), . . . , (x n , y n , z n ), we define a notion of biologically similar sequences V using Block Substitution Matrices (BLOSUM) (Henikoff and Henikoff 1992), and then employ formulations of adversarial attacks (Goodfellow, McDaniel, and Papernot 2018) on PFNNs within this space of similar sequences to identify a sequence S adv ∈ V that produces a maximally different three-dimensional structure A(S adv ).
- We then compute the RMSD and GDT between the structures for the original and adversarial inputs (A(S) and A(S adv )), and use these metrics as the robustness measure.
- If the RMSD (GDT) is small (high), the response of the PFNN is deemed robust; a large (small) RMSD (GDT) indicates that the predicted structure is not robust.

### BLOSUM Similarity Measures
- The Hamming distance is not a good measure of sequence similarity
- There are many different ways to measure sequence similarity
- The PAM1, PAM10, PAM30, PAM70, and PAM120 matrices are models that use empirical data to calculate similarity
- The BLOSUM approach uses conserved blocks or conserved sub-sequences to calculate similarity

## Approach
- The paper discusses the idea of adversarial examples in PFNNs and how to evaluate the robustness of a PFNN.
- The paper uses the RMSD and GDT between the structure of an original protein sequence and the structure of the adversarial sequence as a measure of robustness.
- In this work, the AlphaFold model is focused on.

### Output Structural Measure
- The three dimensional structure of a sequence of residues is an ordered n-tuple of threedimensional co-ordinates.
- The standard structural distance measure used in this work is the RMSD, measured in Å.
- The GDT similarity measure is another standard metric for gauging the similarity of protein structures.
- The GDT score returns a value in [0, 1] where 1 indicates identical structures.

### Adversarial Attacks on PFNNs
- Small carefully crafted changes in a few pixels of input images cause well-trained neural networks with otherwise high accuracy to consistently produce incorrect responses in domains such as computer vision
- In our experiments, we set L = 20 and D str as the RMSD measure.
- Given a sequence of interest S with n residues, the search space can be extensively large.
- Therefore, we select random samples from V L,H (S) and choose the sequence that returns the maximum value based on the RMSD measure.
- Our approach to generating adversarial sequences falls under the class of black-box attacks.

## Complexity
- The PAA problem is NP-complete.
- The CLIQUE problem is reduced to an instance of the PAA problem.
- There is a clique of size k in G if and only if there is a feasible solution S in = S to the reduced PAA instance.

## Experimental Results
- Default settings of the latest version of AlphaFold are used
- Multi-sequence alignment (MSA) step is used
- Five-model ensembles predictions are made
- Recycling is used
- Output confidence ranking is used
- Amber relaxation is used
- Alignment algorithm is used without outlier rejections
- Parameters of PyMOL alignment are selected using the default settings
- Adversarial sequences are generated by randomly sampling 20 sequences from the set V L,H in (5) with H = 5 and L = 20
- The location of the flipped residues is selected based on three categories: (i) residues with confidence values near the MIN. category, (ii) the average score, and (iii) the maximum confidence score

### COVID-19 Case Studies
- We apply our adversarial approach to 111 publicly available COVID-19 protein sequences
- We observe that, independent of the predicted structure of the original sequence, a small change in the input sequence results in significant changes in the output structures
- The resulting structural distances (similarities) measured in Å (percentage) are given in terms of the RMSD (GDT-TS) in the fourth (sixth) column of Table 9 for the full database configuration
- Furthermore, we report the results using GDT-HA in the eighth column.
- The high similarity between the original and adversarial sequences is observed from the third column.
- The similarity percentage is calculated as 100(n − D ham (S, S ))/n, where D ham (S, S ) ≤ H = 5.
- The complete results of all the considered proteins, including reduced AlphaFold configuration, are provided in the supplementary material.
- As observed from the RMSD and GDT results in Table 9, small changes in the input sequence corresponding to only five residues cause AlphaFold to predict structures that are highly divergent from the predicted structure of the original sequence.
- The last column in Table 9 reports the total execution time (in days) of running the 20 adversarial sequences that were randomly selected from the set V L,H , which is shown to scale with the sequence length.
- We only select 20 samples given the long time incurred by AlphaFold to predict the output structure.
- Additionally, in Table 13, we report the average (deviation) prediction confidence results as for all the residues (designated with subscript 'all') and for the 5 altered residues (subscript 'diff').
- The standard deviation is denoted σ.
- We ob-serve that, independent of the average prediction confidence, the RMSD between the original and adversarial predicted structures is always high.
- Moreover, we observe that AlphaFold predicts the adversarial structure with similar confidence values to the original sequence (e.g., see the 4th and 8th columns in both tables).
- The same observation holds for the entire sequence and for the altered residues (columns 6 and 10).
- In Tables 14 and 15 of the supplementary, we break down GDT scores between the structures of the original and perturbed sequences based on the prediction confidence scores of the original sequence.
- We use the regions (1 to 4) defined by AlphaFold.
- As observed w.r.t. all regions, GDT scores are, in general, low.
- For the considered dataset, the values presented in Table 5 gauge the overall robustness of AlphaFold to adversarial sequences.

## Conclusion
- The groundbreaking progress made in recent years on the prediction of protein folding structures promises to enable profound advances in the understanding of diseases, the mapping of the human proteome, and the design of drugs and therapeutics.
- Until these predictions are shown to be robust, we argue that the grand challenge of predictive protein folding persists.
- In this paper, we have presented the first work in this direction by demonstrating that Protein Folding Neural Networks (PFNNs) are often susceptible to adversarial attacks in the form of minor perturbations to the input protein sequence.
- These perturbations can induce great changes in the predicted protein structure and the resulting lack of robustness precludes the adoption of such PFNNs in safety-critical applications.
- We have employed standard protein structural distance and similarity to measure the robustness of AlphaFold. While the perturbation methods employed in this paper were basic for the purposes of illustrating the lack of robustness of PFNNs, the results presented herein can be readily used as a baseline for future work on adversarial attacks on PFNNs and their robustness.

# Abstract
- MRI of brain can provide detailed neuroanatomy
- Automated segmentation methods for brain mapping in ex vivo MRI are not well developed
- High resolution dataset of 37 ex vivo post-mortem human brain tissue specimens scanned on 7T whole-body MRI scanner
- Deep learning pipeline developed to segment cortical mantle
- Segment four subcortical structures, white matter hyperintensities, and normal appearing white matter
- Excellent generalizing capabilities across whole brain hemispheres in different specimens
- Volumetric and localized cortical thickness measurements linked with semi-quantitative neuropathological ratings

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Neurodegenerative diseases are heterogeneous, with multiple distinct processes contributing to neurodegeneration

## Materials

### Donor cohort
- Analyzed a dataset of 37 MRI scans
- Scans were ex vivo whole-hemisphere

### Mri acquisition
- Specimen was immersed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 4 weeks before imaging.
- Samples were placed in Fomblin for range of specimens with different diseases.

### Neuropathological ratings
- Tissue blocks were extracted from the contralateral hemisphere
- Immunohistochemistry used to detect amyloid beta, phosphorylated tau, phosphorylated TDP-43, and Î±-synuclein
- Semi-quantitative ratings of pathology assigned on a scale of 0-3
- Global ratings of neurodegenerative disease progression derived

### Localized thickness measurement pipeline at key cortical locations
- Center adopted expert-supervised semi-automatic protocol
- Protocol defines anatomical landmark
- Semi-automatic level set segmentation of surrounding cortical ribbon provided
- Maximally inscribed sphere computed using Voronoi skelentonization
- Diameter of sphere gives thickness at landmark

## Methods
- Described manual segmentation protocols for cortical gray matter, four subcortical structures, white matter hyperintensities, and normal-appearing white matter
- Described deep learning-based pipeline and performance evaluation criteria for automated segmentation
- Described statistical models to link neuropathological ratings with morphometry based on volume and regional thickness measurements

### Manual segmentation protocols
- Developed protocols to manually segment structures in ex vivo MRI
- Used manual segmentations and MR images to train neural networks
- Sampled 5 3D image patches of size 64 x 64 x 64 voxel around OFC, ATC, IPFC, PMC, and PSC
- Manual segmentation of cortical gray matter supervised by author P.K.
- Followed guiding principles for manual segmentation: outermost layer of cortex labeled as gray matter

### Automated deep learning-based segmentation for cortical gray matter
- Developed an approach for labeling cortical gray matter in ex vivo 7 T MRI scans
- Used PyTorch and Nvidia Quadro RTX 5000 GPUs to train models
- Evaluated accuracy of cortical segmentation by six-fold cross-validation
- Compared automated and manual segmentation-based cortical thickness measures
- Selected best-performing model (nnU-Net) for subsequent experiments

### Automated deep learning-based segmentation for other structures
- Used nnU-Net model for automated segmentation of subcortical structures, WMH and normal-appearing WM
- Trained separate nnU-Net models for segmentation of subcortical structures and WMH using manually-labeled training data

### Linking neuropathology ratings with morphometry
- Spearman's correlation was used to compare thickness measurements from automated segmentations and semi-quantitative pathology ratings.
- The hypothesis was that similar trends would be seen between pathology correlations with automated and manual thickness measures.
- The experiment was done on a subset of the cohort with AD as the primary diagnosis (N=22).
- Nuisance covariates (age, sex and postmortem interval) were not included.
- nnU-Net was selected as the preferred model for cortical gray matter segmentation.
- Strong correlation was observed between reference standard and automated nnU-Net segmentation-based thickness measurements.
- High ICC scores were observed with 9 regions having ICC greater than 0.7.

### Other structures: subcortical, wmh and wm segmentation
- nnU-Net was used to perform multi-label segmentation
- Results of the segmentation for the four subcortical structures and WMH were 79.70%, 88.18%, 85.20%, 80.12%, and 87.29% respectively
- Figures 9 and 10 show qualitative results for all the segmented structures in 2D and 3D
- Future scans will be done at 0.28 x 0.28 x 0.28 mm resolution for further analyses

### Morphometry associations with underlying neuropathology
- Automated segmentations provide meaningful associations with underlying neuropathological measurements
- Significant negative one-sided Spearman's correlation between regional cortical thickness and pathology ratings
- Significant negative one-sided Spearman's correlation between regional cortical thickness and normalized WMH volume
- Significant negative one-sided partial Spearman's correlation between subcortical structures and normalized WMH volume
- Significant differences between AD and Tau-4R, AD and FTLD-TDP, Tau-4R and LBD, Tau-4R and Tau-Misc, FTLD-TDP and Tau-Misc in caudate
- Significant differences between AD and FTLD-TDP, and AD and Tau-4R in putamen

## Discussion
- Current study is the most comprehensive assessment of automated segmentation of 7 T ex vivo human brain MRI
- Evaluated in a cohort of 37 brain specimens with a range of neurodegenerative pathologies
- Evaluated nine deep learning architectures using direct metrics of segmentation accuracy, derived morphological metrics, and visual assessment
- Automated ex vivo segmentation may make the labor-intensive and subjective semi-automated approach to cortical thickness measurement employed unnecessary
- Limitations include a relatively small training set for cortical gray matter segmentation and not imposing topological constraints on the segmentation
- Pipeline labels cortical gray matter, four subcortical structures, WMH, and normal-appearing white matter
- Good agreement between thickness measures derived from deep learning pipeline with reference standard of semi-automated thickness measurement
- Analysis linking morphometry measures and pathology demonstrated that automated analysis of ex vivo MRI yields similar findings to labor-intensive semi-automated approach
- Released pipeline as a stand-alone containerized tool
- Cohort included 12 female and 25 male donors with Alzheimer's Disease or Related Dementias
- Autopsy performed at the Penn Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research
- Limitations include using semi-quantitative measures of neuropathology and relying on contralateral hemispheres
- Future studies may apply dataset and pipeline to help disentangle the differential contributions of unique pathologies to individual atrophy patterns

## Introduction
- Recent progress in generative AI and large language models (LLMs)
- LLMs can process and produce various forms of sequential data
- A new rubric proposed to measure the overall exposure of tasks to GPTs
- 19% of jobs have at least 50% of their tasks exposed to GPTs
- 3% of U.S. workers have over half of their tasks exposed to GPTs
- 49% of workers could have half or more of their tasks exposed to LLMs
- Occupations with higher wages generally present with high exposure
- Science and critical thinking skills negatively correlated with exposure
- Programming and writing skills positively associated with LLM exposure
- Higher barriers to entry in jobs tend to experience more exposure to LLMs
- Information processing industries exhibit high exposure
- Weak connection between productivity growth and overall GPT exposure
- GPTs are general-purpose technologies

## Literature review

### The advancement of large language models
- LLMs have risen to prominence in AI research
- LLMs can tackle complex language-based tasks
- Factors such as increased model parameter count, greater training data volume, and enhanced training configurations have fueled progress
- LLMs excel in diverse applications like translation, classification, creative writing, and code generation
- Methods like fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with human feedback have improved the steerability, reliability, and utility of LLMs
- LLMs have potential to program and control other digital tools
- LLMs are becoming increasingly integrated into specialized applications
- LLMs may be unreliable for various tasks due to issues such as factual inaccuracies, inherent biases, privacy concerns, and disinformation risks
- LLMs can become valuable assets in machine learning model development
- LLMs can contribute to economic decision-making at the task level
- LLMs can continuously enhance performance, but bring a variety of serious risks

### The economic impacts of automation technologies
- Research has shown that technological progress raises the demand for skilled workers over unskilled workers
- Studies have explored the effects of technological change and automation on workers within a task-based framework
- Workers involved in routine and repetitive tasks are at a higher risk of technology-driven displacement
- New technology increases the need for a wider array of labor-intensive tasks
- Automation technologies have resulted in wage inequality in the US
- Various approaches have been used to estimate the overlap between AI capabilities and the tasks and activities workers undertake in different occupations
- Realization of general purpose technologies' full potential requires extensive co-invention
- Many studies of machine learning technologies focus on systems-level adoption
- Task-level information is used to assess whether LLMs fulfill GPT criteria
- Findings are aggregated to occupations and industries to capture the overall potential exposure in the contemporary U.S. labor market

## Methods and data collection

### Data on activities and tasks performed by occupation in the us
- Used O*NET 27.2 database
- Contains information on 1,016 occupations
- Detailed Work Activities (DWAs) and tasks
- Sample of tasks and DWAs in Table 1
- 19,265 tasks with task description and occupation
- Most tasks associated with one or more DWAs
- 2,087 DWAs with most connected to one or more tasks

### Data on wages, employment, and demographics
- Obtained employment and wage data from 2020 and 2021 Occupational Employment series
- Dataset includes occupational titles, number of workers, and employment projections for 2031
- Typical education and on-the-job training required for entry in an occupation
- Used BLS-recommended crosswalk to O*NET to link O*NET task and DWA dataset
- BLS Labor Force Demographics derived from Current Population Survey

### Exposure
- Human ratings and GPT-4 ratings were collected using an exposure rubric
- Rubric defines exposure as a measure of whether access to a GPT or GPT-powered system would reduce the time required for a human to perform a specific DWA or complete a task by at least 50 percent
- Three primary measures of exposure were constructed: E1, E2, and E3
- E1 corresponds to the lower bound of the proportion of exposed tasks within an occupation
- E2 is the sum of E1 and 0.5*E2, accounting for additional investment
- E3 is the sum of E1 and E2, an upper bound of exposure
- E3 is used for the remainder of the analysis, assuming tasks directly exposed are considered twice as exposed as tasks requiring complementary innovation

### Limitations of our methodology
- Validity of task-based framework
- Relative vs. absolute measures
- Lack of expertise and task interpretation
- Forward-looking and subject to change
- Sources of disagreement between humans and GPT-4
- Human raters and GPT-4 ratings show high degree of agreement
- Biased judgments due to lack of occupational diversity
- High-quality labels require workers engaged in occupations
- GPT-4 sensitive to wording, order, composition, detail, and definitions
- Iterating on prompt can enhance agreement between model and rubric
- GPT-4 capable of applying intricate taxonomies

## Results
- General-purpose technologies are rare and have pervasive, long-term impacts.
- GPTs can influence labor, productivity, and capital input.
- GPTs have the potential to affect a diverse range of occupations and wage structures.

### Summary statistics
- Average occupation-level values suggest 15% of tasks are exposed to GPTs
- Over 30% of tasks are exposed to GPTs for some occupations, and over 50% for others
- 80% of workers belong to an occupation with at least one task exposed to GPTs
- 19% of workers are in an occupation where over half the tasks are labeled as exposed

### Wages and employment
- Exposure intensity across the economy is displayed in Figure 3
- Exposure is measured in terms of total workers and total occupations
- Worker concentration in occupations is not highly correlated with occupational exposure to GPTs or GPT-powered software
- Human and GPT-4 annotations exhibit qualitative similarities and tend to correlate
- Higher wages are associated with increased exposure to GPT
- Potential exposure to GPTs has little correlation with current employment levels

### Skill importance
- Skill importance and exposure measures are related
- Science and critical thinking skills are negatively associated with exposure
- Programming and writing skills are positively associated with exposure

## Barriers to entry
- Job Zone is a proxy for barriers to entry
- Median income increases with Job Zone
- Exposure to GPT increases from Job Zone 1 to 4, then decreases or remains similar at Job Zone 5
- Higher wage occupations tend to be more exposed to GPT
- Bachelor's, Master's, and professional degrees are more exposed to GPT than those without formal education
- Jobs with least exposure require longest training, lower payoff
- Jobs with no on-the-job training required or only internship/residency required yield higher income but are more exposed to GPT

## Validation of measures

### Comparison to earlier efforts
- Aim to build on previous studies of occupational exposure to AI and automation
- Previous studies used a variety of methods
- Mapping text descriptions of tasks to descriptions of technological advances in patents
- Linking capabilities of AI systems to occupational abilities
- Mapping results of AI task benchmark evaluations to worker tasks
- Expert labeling of automation potential for certain occupations
- Developing a rubric for evaluating the "suitability for machine learning"
- Summary statistics on many of these prior efforts
- Methodology builds upon the SML approach
- Results of OLS regressions of new LLM exposure measurements on occupation-level exposure measures
- Four separate output variables representing new scores
- Generally positive and statistically significant correlations between LLM exposure measures and previous measurements
- Encouragingly, SML exposure scores show significant and positive associations
- Webb software and AI patent-based measures, SML, and normalized routine cognitive and manual scores all exhibit positive associations
- Low correlations with Felten et al. and Frey and Osborne
- 28-40% unexplained variance compared to other measurements

## Discussion

### Gpts as a general-purpose technology
- GPTs could be classified as a general-purpose technology if they meet three criteria
- GPTs are improving in capabilities over time
- GPTs can have pervasive impacts across the economy
- Complementary innovations enabled by GPTs can have widespread application to economic activity
- Adoption and use of LLMs is becoming increasingly widespread
- Adoption of LLMs will vary across different economic sectors due to various factors

### Implications for us public policy
- Automation technologies, including LLMs, have been linked to economic disparity and labor disruption.
- Results from the US suggest the need for policy preparedness for the potential economic disruption posed by LLMs.
- Prior work has suggested policy directions related to education, worker training, and safety net programs.

### Limitations and future work
- Study has limitations that need further investigation
- Focus on US restricts generalizability
- Need to extend scope and share methods
- Need to explore GPT adoption patterns and actual capabilities/limitations of state-of-the-art models
- Need to consider vision capabilities in ratings

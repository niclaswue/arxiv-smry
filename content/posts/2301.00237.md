- We find all subsets of applications on the diversity-merit Pareto frontier.
- In addition, we provide two novel characterizations of matroids.

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Confucius argued that those who govern should do so because of merit, not because of inherited status.
- The Han dynasty adopted Confucianism and implemented civil service examinations to select and promote government officials.
- Plato, in his book The Republic, stated that the wisest should rule, and hence rulers shall be philosopher kings.
- A system based on meritocracy, however, may increase economic inequality and social and political dysfunction, the so-called meritocracy trap.
- To decrease the inequities that exist, affirmative action and diversity policies have been implemented worldwide.
- The diversity choice rule as defined always finds a set of applications that maximizes diversity and merit. However, it is myopic in the second step, and does not necessarily maximize the merit of the chosen set among sets that maximize diversity.
- To address this problem, we consider a restriction on the diversity index under which it lexicographically maximizes diversity and merit, and is computationally fast.
- Ordinal concavity requires that, from two different distributions of types, when one gets closer to each other, either the value of the diversity index strictly increases on at least one side or the value of the diversity index remains the same on both sides.

## Model
- The university has a strict preference relation (linear order) over student contracts, contracts merit dominates student contracts, and contracts in set X merit dominates contracts in set Y.
- There exists a type function τ : S → T that specifies a type τ (s) ∈ T for each student s ∈ S.
- A type specifies diversity-related traits that the university cares about.
- For each student type t ∈ T, there exists a contract c ∈ C and school s ∈ S such that c t s.
- The number of contracts between a student of type t ∈ T and school c ∈ C in set X is denoted by ξ t c.
- For each distribution ξ ∈ Z | t∈T ξ t c ≤ q} for some q ∈ Z + , there exists a contract c ∈ C and school s ∈ S such that ξ t c (c, s) ≤ q.
- The weak inequality in the definition of pseudo M ♮ -concavity holds.

## Mathematical Preliminaries
- The matroid is a pair (X , F ) where X is a finite set of contracts and F is a collection of subsets of X that satisfies the following three properties.
- Set X is called the ground set of the matroid. Every set in F is called an independent set. An independent set X is called a base if no proper superset of X is independent.
- In addition, the set of bases B is characterized by the following two properties. More precisely, if (X , F ) is a matroid, then the set of its bases satisfies B1 and B2; moreover, if a collection of subsets B satisfies B1 and B2, then there exists a matroid of which B is the set of bases.
- The greedy rule produces an independent set that maximizes the total weight among all independent sets that can be chosen.

## A Lexicographic Approach to Diversity and Merit
- The diversity choice rule always produces an outcome that maximizes diversity among subsets of the set of applications.
- Ordinal concavity is weaker than the existing discrete concavity notions.
- The diversity choice rule lexicographically maximizes diversity first and merit second in a computationally efficient way.
- Ordinal concavity is satisfied when f represents a single-peaked preference relation.
- The first result shows that, when f is ordinally concave, the diversity choice rule lexicographically maximizes diversity first and merit second in a computationally efficient way.

### Sketch of the Proof of Theorem 1.
- The first statement in Theorem 1 that the diversity choice rule outcome maximizes diversity among all subsets of the set of applications follows by construction.
- The proof that C d (X) maximizes merit among all subsets of X that maximize diversity has three main steps and uses discrete convexity notions as well as matroid theory.
- Step 1: The set of maximal distributions in Ξ * (X) is an M-convex set. First, we study the structure of Ξ * (X) that we find in the diversity choice rule construction. We show that if the diversity index f is ordinally concave, then Ξ * (X) satisfies M ♮convexity. Since the diversity choice rule produces an outcome that is maximal in Ξ * (X), we focus on maximal distributions in Ξ * (X). By Lemma 2, the set of maximal distributions in an M ♮ -convex set is M-convex; therefore, the set of maximal distributions in Ξ * (X) is M-convex (Lemma 4).
- Consider Example 1. Let n = 5 and X = {x, y, z}. For the first step, we maximize f on Ξ 0 = {ξ : ||ξ|| ≤ 2} and get Ξ * (X) = {ξ({z}), ξ({x, z}), ξ({y, z})}, which is an M ♮ -convex set. The set of maximal distributions in Ξ * (X) is equal to {ξ({x, z}), ξ({y, z})}, which is an M-convex set.
- Step Next, we consider subsets of X that have a distribution less than or equal to a distribution in Ξ * (X), and, hence, these sets have a distribution less than or equal to a maximal distribution in Ξ * (X). F (X) is the collection of such sets. Depending on the merit ranking, the diversity choice rule can produce any maximal set in F (X) because in Step 2 of the diversity choice rule construction contracts are chosen so that the outcome has a maximal distribution in Ξ * (X). Therefore, the structure of maximal sets in F (X) plays a crucial role. We show M-convexity of the set of maximal distributions in Ξ * (X) implies that the maximal sets in F (X) satisfy the base axioms B1 and B2', which we provide in Lemma 1, so (X, F (X)) is a matroid (Lemma 5).
- In Example 1, when n = 5 and X = {x, y, z}, the set of maximal distributions in Ξ * (X) is equal to {ξ({x...

## Maximizing Merit Subject to a Diversity Level
- A university administration may want to maximize merit of an incoming freshman class subject to attaining a given diversity level instead of lexicographically maximizing these two objectives.
- In this section, we introduce a class of choice rules, parameterized by the diversity level, that achieves this goal.
- Using this class, we provide an algorithm that produces the diversity-merit Pareto frontier.

### Maximizing Merit Subject to a Target Diversity Level.
- The diversity choice rule is defined using the diversity index f λ .
- f λ is ordinally concave for each λ ≥ 0 .
- The diversity choice rule is applicable to the choice rule of a single school with saturated diversity and a capacity constraint.

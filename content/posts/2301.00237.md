# Abstract
- Provide optimal solutions to institutions with dual goals of diversity and meritocracy.
- Provide a class of choice rules to maximize merit while attaining a diversity level.

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Meritocratic systems have been idealized since ancient times.
- Confucius argued that those who govern should do so based on merit.
- Han dynasty adopted Confucianism and implemented civil service examinations.
- Plato stated that the wisest should rule.
- Meritocracy may increase economic inequality and social and political dysfunction.
- Affirmative action and diversity policies have been implemented worldwide.
- Institutions rank applications according to merit.
- Diversity of a group is given by an index defined as a function of traits.
- We study a class of choice rules that maximize merit and attain a diversity level.
- Diversity choice rule maximizes diversity and maximizes merit among sets that maximize diversity.
- Diversity choice rule is path independent when the diversity index is ordinally concave.
- Diversity choice rule satisfies the law of aggregate demand when the diversity index is monotone and ordinally concave.
- We provide a characterization of diversity indices such that the modified diversity index for every diversity level is ordinally concave.
- Trace algorithm finds all subsets of applications on the diversity-merit Pareto frontier.
- If a choice rule is path independent, then there exists an ordinally concave objective function.
- Our results apply to markets where institutions have two distinct goals.

## Model
- Finite set of academic schools (C) and students (S) applying to university

## Mathematical preliminaries
- Matroids are pairs (X, F) where X is a finite set of contracts and F is a collection of subsets of X.
- B1 and B2' characterize the set of bases of a matroid.
- Greedy algorithm is a well-known algorithm in combinatorial optimization.
- Greedy rule produces an independent set that maximizes total weight when (X, F) is a matroid.
- Path independence and law of aggregate demand characterize matroids.

## A lexicographic approach to diversity and merit
- Introduction of ordinal concavity and a new choice rule that maximizes diversity first and merit second
- Choice rule has 4 steps: max ξ, set X0, choose x of highest merit, add 1 to k
- Ordinal concavity is weaker than existing discrete concavity notions
- 3 possible implications of ordinal concavity for univariate functions
- 2 possible directions for multivariate functions
- Theorem 1: when f is ordinally concave, the diversity choice rule lexicographically maximizes diversity first and merit second
- Examples 2-4 of ordinally concave diversity indices

### Sketch of the proof of theorem 1.
- Theorem 1 states that the diversity choice rule outcome maximizes diversity among all subsets of the set of applications.
- Step 1 of the proof shows that the set of maximal distributions in Ξ * (X) is an M-convex set.
- Step 2 of the proof shows that the maximal sets in F (X) satisfy the base axioms B1 and B2', making (X, F (X)) a matroid.
- Step 3 of the proof shows that the greedy rule on matroid (X, F (X)) produces C d (X).
- The proof of the third statement in Theorem 1 works in two main steps.
- Step 1 of the third statement involves finding a distribution that maximizes the diversity index.
- Step 2 of the third statement simplifies the process of checking all maximizers to checking only local distributions around a maximizer.
- A modified version of the diversity choice rule produces the same outcome as the original one and can be calculated in O(|C| ×|T | ×|X| 2 ).

### Path independence and the law of aggregate demand.
- The diversity choice rule Cd satisfies path independence when the diversity index f is ordinally concave
- Monotonicity fails when n > 5 in Example 1
- Monotonicity holds when n = 5 in Example 1
- Monotonicity is either satisfied without making any assumptions or satisfied by making some additional assumptions in Examples 2, 3 and 4
- Assuming the monotonicity of the diversity index, in addition to ordinal concavity, delivers the law of aggregate demand for the diversity choice rule

## Maximizing merit subject to a diversity level
- University administration wants to maximize merit of incoming freshman class while achieving a given diversity level
- Introduce a class of choice rules to achieve this goal
- Algorithm produces diversity-merit Pareto frontier

### Maximizing merit subject to a target diversity level.
- Goal is to choose a set of applications that maximizes merit while achieving a target diversity level
- Formulated a new diversity index to maximize merit while achieving the target diversity level
- Ordinal concavity of the original diversity index does not necessarily imply ordinal concavity of the new index
- Introduced pseudo M ♮-concavity+ as a stronger condition
- Pseudo M ♮-concavity+ implies ordinal concavity of the new index
- Developed a choice rule that maximizes merit subject to attaining a diversity level of at least λ
- Provided an algorithm to find the diversity-merit Pareto frontier
- Time complexity of the algorithm is O(α× |C| × |T | × |X|2)

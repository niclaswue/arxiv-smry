# Abstract
- Existence of a mechanism studied that weakly improves a policy objective on the distribution of student types to schools.
- Mechanism must satisfy constrained efficiency, individual rationality, and strategy-proofness.
- Mechanism need not exist in general.
- New notion of discrete concavity (M$^{\natural}$-concavity) introduced.
- Mechanism with desirable properties constructed when distributional objective satisfies M$^{\natural}$-concavity.
- Several distributional objectives that are natural in the setting satisfy M$^{\natural}$-concavity.

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- John Maynard Keynes highlighted the combination of economic efficiency, social justice, and individual liberty as the political problem of mankind
- Study this problem in a matching context between schools and students of different types
- Social justice can be interpreted as the policy to improve a distributional objective on student types
- Economic efficiency of a matching can be understood as the requirement that there exists no alternative matching that improves the welfare of students without undermining the distributional objective
- Individual liberty corresponds to the property that no student is forced to be matched with a school against their will
- Strategy-proofness is added as the fourth desideratum
- Distributional policies are usually implemented by reserving seats or positions for target groups in society
- Kamada and Kojima (2015, 2017, 2020) introduce and study matching markets with regional constraints
- Hafalir et al. (2022) introduce the interdistrict school choice problem and study distributional policies
- Suzuki et al. (2018) study a market without student types
- Dur and Ünver (2019) study exchange programs
- Delacrétaz et al. (2019) study refugee resettlement
- Combe et al. (2022) study how to improve assignments upon the initial matching
- Imamura and Kawase (2022) study Pareto efficient matchings
- Yokote (2022) studies an object allocation problem with heterogeneous objects

## Model
- Finite set of schools, students, and student types
- Each student has a type and a preference relation over schools and outside option
- Each school has a capacity
- Matching assigns students to schools or outside option
- Initial matching exists
- Distribution vector for each school and type
- Feasible distributions exist
- Distributional objective function
- Matching weakly improves objective if better than initial
- Pareto dominates if better for at least one student
- Constrained efficient if no better matching
- Individual rationality if better than initial

## Improving the distributional objective
- There exists a mechanism that weakly improves the distributional objective and satisfies constrained efficiency, strategy-proofness, and individual rationality
- For some distributional policies, there is no mechanism with the desirable properties
- Example 1 establishes this fact
- There are two matchings that weakly improve the distributional objective, satisfy constrained efficiency and individual rationality
- If a mechanism satisfies the desired properties, then its outcome must be either matching µ or µ'
- There is a profitable deviation for a student if they misreport their preferences
- A new notion of discrete concavity is introduced
- Pseudo M-concavity is defined
- The failure of a mechanism with the desirable properties in Example 1 is attributed to the policy function failing pseudo M-concavity

### Top trading cycles algorithm.
- Introduce a mechanism that achieves desirable properties when the distributional objective is pseudo M ♮-concave
- Create a hypothetical matching market with school-type pairs, outside option, and students from the original market
- Define preference order Ps over school-type pairs and the outside option
- Define priority ordering of students that school-type pairs and (∅, ∅) use to rank students
- Generalize the top trading cycles mechanism of Shapley and Scarf (1974)
- Algorithm terminates when no student remains to be processed
- Outcome is defined as the matching induced by the outcome of the hypothetical problem
- Theorem 1: TTC weakly improves the distributional objective and satisfies constrained efficiency, individual rationality, and strategy-proofness

## Sets of distributions as policies
- A matching µ satisfies the policy goal Ξ if the distribution associated with µ is in Ξ.
- M ♮ -convexity is a weakening of a standard notion in the mathematics and operations research literatures.
- TTC can be applied within the context of distributional goals.
- For a policy function that is defined as the Chebyshev distance to an M ♮ -convex "ideal set" is pseudo M ♮ -concave.

### Chebyshev distance to a policy set.
- Chebyshev distance is a metric used to measure the distance between two vectors.
- A policy function is used to measure the minimum negative Chebyshev distance to a set of "ideal distributions" for diversity.
- Theorem 3 states that the policy function is pseudo M ♮ -concave, and satisfies certain criteria.

## Applications
- Established general results based on pseudo M♮-concavity of the distributional objective
- Applied results to a variety of distributional objectives
- Exchange-feasibility policy requires total number of students assigned to a district's school do not decrease
- TTC weakly improves the distributional objective and satisfies constrained efficiency, individual rationality, and strategy-proofness
- M♮-convexity of a set applicable for policy goals in the future

### District-level diversity policies.
- District-level diversity policies are considered instead of exchange-feasibility policies.
- There are upper and lower bounds for each district and type.
- The policy goal is not M♮-convex.

## Conclusion
- Studied principles of Keynes in a matching context
- Challenge was to design a mechanism that achieves constrained efficiency, individual rationality, and strategy-proofness while improving upon a distributional objective
- Identified a notion of discrete concavity called pseudo M ♮ -concavity
- Provided an explicit algorithm that achieves those goals, TTC
- Identified a general class of distributional objectives that satisfy sufficient conditions
- TTC works by assigning students to school-type pairs based on a master priority list
- TTC-M satisfies the policy goal, constrained efficiency, individual rationality, and strategy-proofness
- Hypothetical problem with modified policy goal satisfies all conditions assumed by Suzuki et al.
- TTC satisfies the policy goal, constrained efficiency, individual rationality, and strategy-proofness in the original problem

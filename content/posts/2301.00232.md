# Abstract

- We introduce a new notion of discrete concavity that we call pseudo M$^{\natural}$-concavity
- We show that several distributional objectives, that are natural in our setting, satisfy M$^{\natural}$-concavity

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- John Maynard Keynes (1926)
- In practice, distributional policies are usually implemented by reserving seats or positions for target groups in society.
- Kamada and Kojima (2015, 2017, 2020) introduce and study matching markets with regional constraints including the Japanese Residency Market.
- Hafalir et al. (2022) introduce the interdistrict school choice problem and study distributional policies in this context.
- Suzuki et al. (2018) study a market without student types and, therefore, a distribution specifies only the number of students assigned to each school.
- We build on this paper, but there are several crucial differences. First, we allow for student types and, therefore, a distribution in the current setting specifies the number of students of each type at every school.
- The motivation for our modeling approach is that, in practice, distributional policies often depend on student attributes, such as socioeconomic status, and they are introduced because the initial matching does not satisfy them.
- Another difference is that we allow students to be unmatched.
- Motivated by markets in which institutions swap students or workers, Dur and Ünver (2019) study exchange programs and introduce algorithms that satisfy some desirable properties.
- A key difference between their work and ours is that, in Dur and Ünver (2019), both sides of the market have preferences and, therefore, their Pareto efficiency notion takes into account preferences of all agents.
- In contrast, we define efficiency only in terms of student preferences.
- The main distributional policy of Dur and Ünver (2019) imposes lower and upper bounds on the number of students that a college may accept and this interval includes the number of students before the exchange.
- We show that their distributional policy satisfies M ♮ convexity (Proposition 2).
- Another related research is Delacrétaz et al. (2019) who study refugee resettlement. They incorporate various constraints into algorithms similar to the top-trading cycles algorithm.
- Constraints studied in their paper are so general that the constraints may fail M ♮ -convexity and, therefore, their mechanisms do not satisfy Pareto efficiency in general.
- Our study and theirs are complementary in that we identify a class of constraints under which Pareto efficiency can be achieved together with other desiderata while they provide mechanisms that achieve certain efficiency gains over the initial assignment under general constraints, if not full Pareto efficiency.

## Model
- There exist a finite set of schools, a finite set of students, and a finite set of student types.
- Each student has a type and a strict preference relation over the schools and students in the set.
- The corresponding weak order is denoted by R.
- Each school has a capacity and a matching assigns students to schools or to the outside option such that no school is assigned more students than its capacity.
- A distribution is a vector such that the entry for school and type is denoted by ξ.
- A matching weakly improves the distributional objective if f(ξ(µ)) ≥ f(ξ(µ 0 ))
- A matching satisfies individual rationality if each student weakly prefers her outcome in µ to her initial outcome in µ 0 .

## Improving the Distributional Objective

### Top Trading Cycles Algorithm.
- concave. Then TTC weakly improves the distributional objective and satisfies constrained efficiency, individual rationality, and strategy-proofness. The proof of Theorem 1 is given in Appendix D. Our proof utilizes the main result of Suzuki et al. (2018), who study a setting where there are no types and students are not allowed to be unmatched. In their setting, they show that if the distribution is Mconvex, then their mechanism, called TTC-M, satisfies the policy goal, constrained efficiency, individual rationality, and strategy-proofness. In our setting, however, there are multiple types, and not all students need to be initially or eventually matched. We introduce a mechanism that achieves the desirable properties whenever the distributional objective is pseudo M ♮ -concave.
- concave. The outcome is defined as the matching induced by the outcome of the hypothetical problem at this step in the following sense. A student s is allocated to contract (s, c) at the outcome of TTC if and only if, student s is allocated to the school-type pair (c, t) in the hypothetical problem, and a student s is not allocated to a school at the outcome of TTC if and only if, s is allocated to (∅, ∅) in the hypothetical problem.

## Sets of Distributions as Policies
- distributional goal Ξ as a set of distributions. We say that a matching µ satisfies the policy goal Ξ if the distribution associated with µ is in Ξ, i.e., ξ(µ) ∈ Ξ.
- the main assumption we impose on the distributional goals is the following notion of discrete convexity, which is studied in the mathematics and operations research literatures.
- M ♮ -convexity is a weakening of the following property, which is a standard notion in the mathematics and operations research literatures.
- for each M ♮ -convex policy goal, there exists a corresponding policy function satisfying M ♮ -concavity.
- TTC can also be applied within the context of distributional goals via the following corollary.
- suppose that µ satisfies the policy goal Ξ.9 If Ξ is M ♮ -convex, then TTC satisfies the policy goal Ξ, constrained efficiency, individual rationality, and strategy-proofness.

### Chebyshev Distance to a Policy Set.
- Consider the Chebyshev distance (or maximum metric, or L ∞ metric) between any two vectors ξ and ξ: where | . | denotes the absolute value.
- We consider a policy function f Ξ c that measures the minimum (negative)10 Chebyshev distance to a set of "ideal distributions" for diversity that we denote by Ξ (⊂ Ξ 0 ).
- More specifically: The next proposition establishes a positive result for the "Chebyshev distance" policy function, where the diversity is measured via the Chebyshev distance to an ideal policy set which is M ♮ -convex.
- Theorem 3. Consider the policy function f Ξ c and suppose that Ξ is M ♮ -convex. Then, f Ξ c is pseudo M ♮ -concave.
- Therefore, for this policy function, TTC weakly improves the distributional objective and satisfies constrained efficiency, individual rationality, and strategy-proofness.

## Applications
- Now that we have established general results based on pseudo M ♮ -concavity of the distributional objective, we proceed to apply them to a variety of distributional objectives. Specifically, we consider the case of the schools being partitioned into districts, where the set of districts is denoted by D.
- A school c's district is denoted by d(c) ∈ D.
- With a exchange-feasibility policy, we require the total number of students assigned to a district's school do not decrease.
- More specifically, for each d ′ ∈ D, let us denote t,c:d(c)=d ′ Xt c by k d ′ .
- The exchange-feasibility policy is Ξ B ≡ {ξ | t,c:d(c)=d ′ ξ t c ≥ k d ′ for all d ′ ∈ D, and q c ≥ t ξ t c for all c}.
- Proposition 3. For the policy function f Ξ B c , TTC weakly improves the distributional objective and satisfies constrained efficiency, individual rationality, and strategy-proofness.
- One of the advantages of our approach is that M ♮ -convexity of a set (and pseudo M ♮concavity of a function) is so general that a wide variety of policy goals satisfy them and that it is likely to be applicable for policy goals that one may encounter in the future.
- To highlight this point, we consider imposing diversity and exchange-feasibility policies simultaneously. More specifically, define a set of distributions Ξ SB ≡ {ξ | q t c ≥ ξ t c ≥ p t c for all c and t, t,c:d(c)≥d ′ ξ t c ≥ k d ′ for all d ′ ∈ D, and q c ≥ t ξ t c for all c} and call it the combination of exchange-feasibility and school-level diversity policies.
- This is the set of distributions that satisfy both the school-level floors and ceilings and the exchangefeasibility requirement.
- We establish that Ξ SB is M ♮ -convex, implying the following result. In general, the intersection of two M ♮ -convex sets need not be M ♮ -convex.
- Therefore, the proof of this result does not follow from the proofs of Propositions 1 and 3.

### District-level Diversity Policies.
- The policy goal associated with an example in Section 3 fails to be pseudo M ♮ -concavity or M ♮ -convex.
- The main reason for the failure of these two properties is the upper bounds, not the lower bounds.

## Conclusion
- We studied the principles that Keynes laid down as the political problem of mankind in a matching context.
- In our setting, the challenge was to design a mechanism that achieves constrained efficiency, individual rationality, and strategy-proofness while (weakly) improving upon a distributional objective.
- We identified a notion of discrete concavity that we called pseudo M ♮ -concavity and showed that when the distributional objective satisfies this notion, there exists a mechanism with all the desirable properties listed above.
- In fact, we provided an explicit algorithm that achieves those goals, namely a generalization of the celebrated top-trading cycles mechanism (Shapley and Scarf, 1974), which is also easily computable.
- One of our main contributions is to identify a general class of distributional objectives, rather than a specific (and sometimes ad-hoc) objective, under which a mechanism with the desirable properties exists.
- Our sufficient conditions (namely pseudo M ♮ -concavity and M ♮ -convexity) are quite permissive in the sense of being satisfied by many important applications.
- Identifying additional practical examples of distributional objectives that satisfy our sufficient conditions is left for future research.
- We hope that our approach will pave the way for a more systematic analysis of distributional policies.
- For example, in our context, whether pseudo M ♮ -concavity can be weakened for the existence of a mechanism with the desirable properties is an important open question and is left for future research.
- We hope and anticipate that this paper's results will be useful in attaining a better understanding of achieving constrained efficiency in matching environments where distributional policies are in consideration.

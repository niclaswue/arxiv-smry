# Abstract
- Segmentation is an important task in biomedical imaging.
- Deep learning is limited in its ability to generalize across different experimental settings.
- Domain adaptation is a way to train a model on a source dataset with labels and apply it to a target dataset without labels.
- We propose a probabilistic domain adaptation method based on self-training and the Probabilistic UNet.
- We evaluate our method on three domain adaptation tasks for biomedical segmentation.

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Deep learning is the standard approach for image analysis tasks, including segmentation in biomedical imaging.
- Supervised learning requires large labeled training datasets, which can be challenging in biomedical imaging.
- Domain adaptation is a promising remedy to improve generalization and reduce labeling effort.
- Self-training techniques are used to generate pseudo-labels and filter them.
- Probabilistic UNet is used to derive better confidence estimates.
- Method is evaluated on three challenging domain adaptation tasks in biomedical segmentation.

## Related work
- Self-training is a popular approach in semisupervised learning
- Self-training has been applied to classification and semantic segmentation
- Unified framework for semi-supervision and domain adaptation has been proposed
- Self-training methods for domain adaptation in segmentation have been introduced
- Probabilistic segmentation methods learn a distribution over segmentation results

## Methods
- Self-training is a method of semi-supervised learning that uses labeled and unlabeled data to compute supervised and unsupervised loss terms
- Probabilistic segmentation models account for the inherent uncertainty of segmentation tasks
- PUNet combines a UNet with a conditional variational autoencoder to sample diverse predictions
- We propose a family of methods for probabilistic domain adaptation
- We use the dice score for the reconstruction loss and the consensus response for pseudo-label filtering
- We explore two different settings for self-training and three different settings for filtering
- We investigate both the joint and separate domain adaptation strategies

## Results
- Performed experiments for 3 domain adaptation settings
- Model implementation and hyperparameters documented in App. C
- Datasets documented in App. D

- We perform experiments for cell segmentation in livecell microscopy
- We use data from LiveCELL with 5,000 images and cell instance labels
- We transform instance labels to binary masks for semantic segmentation
- We evaluate segmentation quality for all source-target pairs
- We evaluate four of our approaches, a separate and a joint adaptation strategy, with and without masking
- We compare to UNet, PUNet and the method from [3]
- We demonstrate potential for EM mitochondria segmentation using MitoEM
- We demonstrate potential for medical imaging using three datasets for X-Ray lung segmentation
- We study pseudo-label filtering (masking, weighting, no filtering)
- We use UNet and PUNet architecture for all experiments
- We use Adam optimizer and ReduceLROnPlateau learning rate scheduler
- We use different patch shapes, batch sizes and learning rates depending on the dataset and method
- We use gaussian blurring and additive gaussian noise as weak augmentations
- We use gaussian blurring, additive gaussian noise and random contrast adjustments as strong augmentations
- We use PyTorch for implementation
- We use LiveCELL dataset from [3]
- We use dataset of [21] as source dataset for mitochondria segmentation in EM
- We use three datasets for X-Ray lung segmentation: NIH, Montgomery and JSRT

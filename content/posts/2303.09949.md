# Abstract
- Deep neural networks are accurate and powerful wavefunction ansatz for solving the electronic Schr\"odinger equation.
- Optimizing the wavefunction from scratch for each new system is computationally costly.
- A novel neural network ansatz is proposed which maps uncorrelated, computationally cheap Hartree-Fock orbitals to correlated, high-accuracy neural network orbitals.
- This ansatz is capable of learning a single wavefunction across multiple compounds and geometries.
- Pre-training of a generalized wavefunction model across different compounds and geometries could lead to a foundation wavefunction model.
- This model could yield high-accuracy ab-initio energies with minimal computational effort.

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Accurate predictions of quantum mechanical properties for molecules is important for development of new compounds
- Solution to Schrödinger equation yields wavefunction and electron density
- Computing accurate approximations to Schrödinger equation quickly becomes computationally intractable with increasing number of particles
- Deep-learning-based Variational Monte Carlo (DL-VMC) methods have emerged as a high-accuracy approach with favorable scaling
- Improvements and applications have emerged, such as enhancements of architecture, optimization and overall approach
- DL-VMC has been adapted to many different systems and observables
- DL-VMC does not require any input beyond the Hamiltonian
- Computational cost for large-scale use is high
- We propose a novel neural network ansatz which does not depend explicitly on the number of particles
- Our model exhibits strong generalization when transferring weights from small molecules to larger, similar molecules

## Results

### A multi-compound wavefunction ansatz
- Existing high-accuracy approaches for neural network wavefunctions have a specific structure.
- This structure is unsuited to represent wavefunctions for multiple different compounds at once.
- Several potential options exist to overcome this challenge, such as generating a fixed number of orbitals or using separate matrices for each molecule.

### Properties of our ansatz
- Constant parameter count
- Equivariant to sign of HF-orbital
- Locality and high expressivity

### Size consistency of the ansatz
- Design goal of ansatz is to allow transfer of weights from small systems to larger systems.
- Test case is chains of equally spaced Hydrogen atoms of increasing lengths.
- Ansatz achieves high zero-shot-accuracy in interpolation and extrapolation regimes.
- Fine-tuning pre-trained model yields near perfect agreement with specialized MRCI+Q method.
- Results outperform GLOBE+ FermiNet and GLOBE+Moon.

### Equivariance with respect to hf-phase
- Our orbitals are equivariant with respect to a change of sign of the Hartree Fock orbitals.
- We tested our proposed architecture by rotating a H2O molecule and comparing it to a standard backflow matrix.
- The standard backflow-type architecture had a spike in the HF-pre-training loss at the position of the sign flip, causing slower convergence.
- Phase alignment is not possible in all circumstances.

### Transfer to larger, chemically similar compounds
- Experiment tests generalization and transferability of approach
- Train ansatz on dataset of multiple geometries of small compound
- Re-use weights for different geometries of larger compound
- Compare results to DeepErwin and GLOBE
- Measure accuracy with mean energy error and maximum relative energy error
- Our approach yields lower and more consistent energies

### Towards a first foundation model for neural network wavefunctions
- Compiled a dataset of 360 distorted geometries across 18 different compounds
- Pre-trained a basemodel for 500,000 steps on this diverse dataset
- Evaluated performance when computing Potential Energy Surfaces
- Compared results against a baseline model
- Fine-tuning pre-trained model yields substantially lower energies than usual optimization from a HF-pre-trained model

### Scaling behaviour
- Increasing the amount of pre-training leads to better results
- Accuracy depends on model size and number of compounds in pre-training dataset
- Results indicate approach may be sufficient to train accurate multi-compound, multigeometry foundation model for wavefunctions

## Discussion
- Presents an ansatz for deep-learning based VMC
- Can be applied to molecules of arbitrary size
- Properties include extensivity, zero-shot prediction of wavefunctions, invariance to phase of orbitals, and fast finetuning
- First successful demonstration of a general wavefunction trained on diverse dataset
- Pre-training on large data and fine-tuning on specific problems can be applied to wavefunctions
- Outperforms conventional variational methods
- Open questions and limitations to be addressed in future work
- Code, dataset, and model parameters open sourced

## Methods

### Variational monte carlo
- Molecules can be described by the time-independent Schrödinger equation
- Electrons are divided into spin-up and spin-down
- Finding the groundstate wavefunction requires finding the solution to the Schrödinger equation with the lowest eigenvalue
- Approximate solution can be found through minimization of the loss using a parameterized trial wavefunction
- Expectation value is computed by drawing samples from the unnormalized probability distribution using Markov Chain Monte Carlo
- Calculation typically consists of three steps: supervised HF-pre-training, variational optimization, and evaluation

### Obtaining orbital descriptors from hartree-fock
- Hartree-Fock method uses single-particle orbitals to obtain coefficients and orbitals
- Orbitals can be localized using different metrics and localization schemes
- Foster-Boys method is used in this paper
- Graph convolutional neural network is used to add context about surrounding atoms

### Mapping orbital descriptors to wavefunctions
- Combining a high-dimensional electron embedding with a function of the orbital descriptor to obtain entry Φ ik of the Slater determinant
- Functions GCN a θ , f a θ , and g s θ are trainable and (anti-)symmetric with respect to change in sign of their argument c
- Using message-passing architecture outlined in [5] to obtain electron embeddings, which is invariant with respect to permutation of electrons of the same spin
- All samples in a batch come from the same geometry
- Relying on the second order optimizer K-FAC [35,36]
- Increasing initial damping by 10x and decreasing it to 1 × 10 −3 with a inverse scheduler
- Pre-trained runs used a 5x lower initial learning rate with a learning rate scheduler offset o = 32, 000
- Foundation model used 512, 000 optimization steps
- Small-and medium-sized model differ from the large model by the number of hidden layers, neurons per layer, and iterations of the GCN

# Abstract
- RGB-based models suffer from overfitting the training classes and often fail at detecting novel-looking objects
- To address these shortcomings of RGB-based object detectors, we propose incorporating geometric cues such as depth and normals, predicted by general-purpose monocular estimators.
- Our resulting Geometry-guided Open-world Object Detector (GOOD) significantly improves detection recall for novel object categories and already performs well with only a few training classes.

## ABSTRACT
- RGB-based models suffer from overfitting the training classes and often fail at detecting novel-looking objects
- To address these shortcomings of RGB-based object detectors, we propose incorporating geometric cues such as depth and normals
- Our resulting Geometry-guided Open-world Object Detector (GOOD) significantly improves detection recall for novel object categories and already performs well with only a few training classes
- Using a single "person" class for training on the COCO dataset, GOOD surpasses SOTA methods by 5.0% AR@100, a relative improvement of 24%.

## INTRODUCTION
- Object detectors are discouraged from detecting unlabeled objects in the background during training
- Previous works have designed different architectures and training pipelines to avoid suppressing the unannotated objects in the background
- However, these methods still suffer from overfitting the training classes
- In this work, we propose to tackle this challenge by incorporating geometry cues extracted by general-purpose monocular estimators from the RGB images
- We show that such cues significantly improve detection recall for novel object categories on challenging benchmarks

## EXPLOITING GEOMETRIC CUES
- RGB images tend to over-rely on appearance cues, which makes it hard to detect novel objects
- We exploit two types of geometric cues, depth and normals, to mitigate the appearance bias
- The Omnidata model can produce high-quality results, implying that the invariances behind these geometric cues are robust

## PSEUDO LABELING METHOD
- To use the geometric cues to discover unannotated novel objects in the training set, we first train an object proposal network on the depth or normal input using the same training loss as in (2), i.e., Phase-I training in Figure 3.
- Then, this object proposal network will pseudo-label the training images using its detected bounding boxes. After filtering out the detected bounding boxes which overlap with the base class annotations, we then add the remaining top-k boxes to the ground truth annotations.
- Here k ∈ {1, 2, 3} is determined for each detector on a small holdout validation set. Finally, we train a new class-agnostic object detector using the RGB image as input and the extended bounding box annotation pool as ground truth, i.e., Phase-II in Figure 3.
- The training loss is Compared with (2), the anchors that overlap with the pseudo boxes of the detected novel objects, i.e., i ∈ B N , are also involved in training.

## EXPERIMENTS
- Benchmarks: We target two major challenges of open-world class-agnostic object detection: crosscategory and cross-dataset generalization.
- For the cross-category evaluation, we follow the common practice in the literature (Kim et al., 2021;Wang et al., 2022) to split the class category list into two parts. One is used as the base class for training, whereas the other is reserved only for testing crosscategory generalization.
- Specifically, we adopt two splits of the 80 classes in the COCO dataset (Lin et al., 2014). The first benchmark splits the COCO classes into a single "person" class and 79 nonperson classes. This is to stress-test the generalization ability of the methods. We follow Wang et al. (2022) to choose the "person" category as the training class because it contains diverse viewpoints and shapes.
- The second benchmark splits the COCO classes into 20 PASCAL-VOC (Everingham et al., 2010) classes for training and the other 60 for testing.
- For the cross-dataset evaluation, we use the ADE20K dataset (Zhou et al., 2019) for testing. We compare models trained using only 20 PASCAL-VOC classes or all 80 COCO classes on detecting objects in ADE20K. This is to evaluate open-world class-agnostic object detectors when used in the wild.
- We use the same architecture as OLN in (Kim et al., 2021)

## ADVANTAGES OF GEOMETRIC CUES
- Geometric cues are better than edges and pairwise affinities at detecting novel objects.
- Geometric cues are better than adding shape bias and multi-scale augmentation at detecting novel objects.
- Geometric cues are better than RGB-based models with inductive shape bias at detecting novel objects.

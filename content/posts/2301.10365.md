# Abstract
- Motion artifacts can lead to incorrect diagnosis or characterization in imaging studies.
- A deep network can reduce the joint image-motion parameter search to a search over rigid motion parameters.
- The network is trained using simulated, motion-corrupted k-space data.
- Experiments on simulated and realistic 2D fast spin echo brain MRI show high reconstruction fidelity.
- Code is available online.

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Motion can corrupt MRI images and make them difficult to interpret
- Prospective motion correction strategies can adjust the acquisition in real-time, but can be disruptive to clinical workflows
- Retrospective strategies correct motion algorithmically after acquisition, without additional motion information
- This paper develops a deep learning method for retrospective rigid motion correction
- The method is trained on simulated pairs of corrupted and corrected examples and generalizes to a proof-of-concept acquired k-space example
- The method produces reconstructions that are consistent with the acquired k-space measurements in the presence of inter-shot motion

## Methods
- Two stages to motion correction procedure: training a network and test-time optimization
- MRI forward model described
- Neural network training uses MRI forward model
- Hypernetwork architecture used to generate weights of reconstruction subnetwork
- Weights of reconstruction subnetwork never trained directly
- Test-time optimization involves minimizing data consistency term and maximizing priors
- Reconstruction network weights frozen at test-time
- Loss monitored to determine success of motion correction procedure

## Experiments
- Data used is 2D T2 FLAIR FSE brain MRI k-space data from 3T GE Signa Premier
- Dataset split into 553/197/100 training/validation/test 2D slices from 31/11/9 subjects
- Motion simulated by applying ARC reconstruction, estimating coil sensitivity profiles, and synthesizing motion-corrupted measurements
- Network architectures include hypernetwork and reconstruction subnetwork
- Networks trained with SSIM loss function and Adam optimizer
- Test-time optimization uses 4 trials of gradient descent
- Baselines include ARC, Conv, Model-Based-GT, and HN-GT

## Results
- HN produces sharper, more accurate reconstructions than motion-naive methods
- HN outperforms motion-naive methods across the test set
- HN recovers accurate motion parameters for the first four high-energy shots
- HN does not reliably recover motion parameters for the last two shots
- HN successfully reconstructs motion-corrupted real k-space signals

## Discussion and conclusions
- Proposed deep rigid motion correction approach for multi-shot MRI
- Evaluated on 2D FSE T2 FLAIR data
- Learns mapping between corrupted k-space data, true motion parameters, and high-quality reconstructions
- At test-time, only motion parameter estimates are optimized
- Automatically rejects samples where optimization fails
- Produces high-quality reconstructions in simulation and generalizes to realistic acquired k-space example

- Overview of experimental, analytical and mathematical methods used to study microscale motility
- Identify transferable techniques, challenges and future directions in the field

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Motility is important for organisms to find resources, evade predators, and locate suitable habitats.
- Chemical energy is converted into mechanical energy to control movement.
- Microscopic organisms have evolved self-propulsion mechanisms to navigate their environment.
- Microbial motility can influence food web dynamics and the structuring of ecosystems.
- Single-cell technologies and advancements in analytical and theoretical methods can help us understand individual microscale organisms.
- Recent reviews have described motility mechanisms based on protein architectures.
- Different experimental, analytical, and mathematical methods are used to study microscale motility mechanisms.

## Mechanisms of microscale motility
- Microscopic organisms use mechanisms to propel themselves through fluid or move across surfaces
- Different mechanisms can be used to achieve the same type of locomotion (e.g. swimming, gliding, walking)

### Swimming
- Low Reynolds number (Re) means viscous forces are much larger than inertial forces.
- Drag coefficient is different for thin rods moving parallel or perpendicular to its long axis.
- Flagella and archaella are long, thin filaments driven by membrane-embedded rotary motors.
- Cilia are more complex and produce bending waves used for swimming.
- Cilia are found in multicellular animals and can bundle together to form compound cilia.
- Swimming can also be achieved without appendages, e.g. Spiroplasma sp. and Synechococcus sp.

### Surface motility
- Bacteria can move on surfaces using twitching motility
- Twitching is generated by Type IV pili
- Gliding is another form of surface motility
- Gliding requires adhesive compounds and a motor protein
- Protrusion-based locomotion is used by some organisms
- Protrusion-based locomotion is driven by actin-polymerization or hydrostatic pressure
- Cilia-based surface motility is used by some organisms
- Cilia-based surface motility is powered by intraflagellar transport mechanism

## Current techniques for studying microscale motility
- High-resolution microscopy, high-speed imaging, micromanipulation, image segmentation and tracking, machine learning, and modeling low Reynolds number fluid mechanics are techniques used to explore microscale motility
- Combining these techniques can broaden understanding of microscopic life

### Experimental methods
- Live imaging is used to investigate motility
- Most live imaging is 2D
- 3D imaging techniques have been developed and improved
- Micromanipulation techniques can be used to study how microscale organisms respond to stimuli
- Micropipettes can be used as force sensors
- Electrophysiological experiments can be used to investigate bioelectric control of motile appendages
- Fluorescent indicators of bioelectric activity can be used to study bioelectric signaling
- Microinjection techniques can be used to introduce fluorescent dyes or precise chemical stimuli
- Optical trapping uses laser light to generate optical forces to manipulate nano- or micro-scale objects
- Microfluidics is used to manipulate fluids at micro-liters and smaller, using micron-sized channels

### Analysis and modeling methods
- Trajectory analysis involves segmentation, detection, and tracking of images to obtain trajectories
- Image processing platforms such as ImageJ and its TrackMate toolkit are used for feature extraction, segmentation, and tracking
- Commonly measured motility parameters include speed, turning angle, angular velocity, path curvature, and location
- Behavioral states are typically classified using trajectory parameters such as speed, acceleration, track curvature, or cell shape
- Singularity methods are approximate solutions of the Stokes equation in the presence of a source of disturbance
- Squirmer model is used to model multiciliated swimmers
- Three main models focusing on individual dynein activity regulation have been proposed

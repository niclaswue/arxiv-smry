# Abstract
- Novel optimization algorithm called DroNeRF for autonomous positioning of monocular camera drones
- Used to generate new views of an object or scene from a set of input images
- Calculates optimized pose for individual drones without using external localization system
- Evaluates quality of generated novel views using perceptual metrics like PSNR and SSIM

# Paper Content

## Iii. overview and methodology
- Finding optimal camera positions for 3D reconstruction is important in computer vision and computer graphics
- Formulate an optimization problem to minimize a cost function based on quality of 3D model, number of cameras, and distance between cameras
- Place drones on a circle at a fixed radius from the object as a starting point
- Use a minimum number of drones with minimal overlap in field of view
- Compute optimal position of cameras to construct 3D model in real-time

### B. drone configuration computation
- Use discrete optimization technique to find optimal drone configuration
- Divide space of possible drone configurations into set P
- Initialize O using greedy algorithm, refine with simulated annealing
- Calculate fitness value based on [2]
- Use fitness function to select optimum pose for set of drones
- Compute object's crude, minimal viable geometry as collection of 3D bounding boxes

### C. seed geometry computation
- Multiple snapshots of an object are taken at 90 degrees
- A 'region' is an area of pixels with common properties
- The Laplacian to the Gaussian kernel is used to compute the minimal viable geometry of the scene
- A multi-scale approach is necessary to capture regions of all different sizes
- The region is found at the maxima of the Laplacian of Gaussian convolved with the image

### D. bounding box estimation
- LoG identifies regions of different sizes, but only the largest region is taken into consideration.
- OpenCV's boundingRect function is used to compute a bounding box around the largest region.
- Centroid of the bounding box is used to control the position of the drone using a PID controller.
- Yaw control of the drone is important to reduce the error between centroid and image frame center.

### E. scene reconstruction
- Goal is to reconstruct 3D scene in near real-time
- Adopt multiresolution hash encoding method from Instant-NGP
- Express scene as 5D vector-value function
- Positional encoding used to capture high-frequency variation
- Hash-based encoding scheme results in faster convergence
- Linear interpolation of feature vectors based on relative position of x

### F. experimentation
- Ryze Robotics Tello EDU version is a small, lightweight, and inexpensive programmable drone
- Used four drones to create a swarm
- Access Point Mode: Drone acts as an access point for a one-to-one connection
- Station Mode: Mesh connection with multiple drones connected to the same access point
- Experiments performed on Ubuntu 22.04.2, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 12 GB of GDDR6X Machine

### B. qualitative and quantitative results
- DroNerf is compared to a baseline method of drone placement
- Experiments conducted on four scenes: human, guitar, robot dog, and recycle bin
- DroNerf produces higher quality NeRF models than the baseline
- DroNerf adjusts drones to capture images with most important details
- DroNerf achieves higher PSNR and SSIM scores than the baseline
- Results suggest DroNerf can lead to higher image quality than the baseline

## V. conclusion and limitations
- Propose a new method called DroNerf for optimizing drone placement in photometric 3D reconstruction
- Takes into account occlusion and visibility of scene surfaces from different drone viewpoints
- Unique camera positioning impacts quality of 3D model
- Demonstrates DroNerf outperforms uniform placement of drones in terms of photometric accuracy
- Effective across different scenes and can achieve significant improvements in photometric quality
- Limitations: relies solely on object geometry, assumes object is stationary, does not consider moving objects

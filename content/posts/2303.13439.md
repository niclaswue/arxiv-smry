# Abstract
- Recent text-to-video generation approaches require large-scale video datasets and computationally heavy training.
- This paper introduces a new task of zero-shot text-to-video generation and proposes a low-cost approach without any training or optimization.
- The proposed approach enriches the latent codes of the generated frames with motion dynamics and reprograms frame-level self-attention.
- Experiments show that this leads to low overhead, yet high-quality and remarkably consistent video generation.
- The approach is applicable to other tasks such as conditional and content-specialized video generation, and Video Instruct-Pix2Pix.

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Generative AI has become popular and successful in computer vision community
- Text-to-image synthesis has been extended to text-to-video generation and editing tasks
- Training with a massive amount of labeled data is costly and unaffordable
- Aim of making video generation cheaper with Tune-A-Video
- Zero-shot, "training-free" text-to-video synthesis proposed in this paper

## Related work

### Text-to-image generation
- Early approaches to text-to-image synthesis relied on template-based generation and feature matching
- GANs improved image quality and diversity
- Transformers introduced new approaches for text-to-image synthesis
- Diffusion models improved text-to-image synthesis quality
- Diffusion models are difficult to apply in the video domain

### Text-to-video generation
- Text-to-video synthesis is a new research direction
- Existing approaches use autoregressive transformers and diffusion processes
- NUWA, Phenaki, CogVideo, VDM, Make-A-Video, Gen-1, and Tune-A-Video are existing approaches
- Our approach is training-free and does not require massive computing power or GPUs

## Method
- Exploiting the text-to-image synthesis power of Stable Diffusion (SD) to approach the zero-shot text-to-video task
- Na√Øve approach is to independently sample m latent codes from standard Gaussian distribution and apply DDIM sampling to obtain the corresponding tensors
- Propose to introduce motion dynamics between the latent codes to keep the global scene time consistent and use cross-frame attention mechanism to preserve the appearance and the identity of the foreground object

### Stable diffusion
- SD is a diffusion model operating in the latent space of an autoencoder.
- SD adds Gaussian noise to the signal x 0 and destroys the initial signal x 0.
- SD learns a backward process to generate a valid signal x 0 from the standard Gaussian noise x T.

### Conditional and specialized text-to-video
- Powerful controlling mechanisms have been developed to guide the text-to-image generation process.
- ControlNet enables the generation process to be conditioned using edges, pose, semantic masks, image depths, etc.
- Modifications to the basic diffusion process for videos result in more consistent videos guided by ControlNet conditions.

### Video instruct-pix2pix
- Our approach combined with Instruct-Pix2Pix outperforms naive per-frame approach and a state-of-the-art method
- Our method preserves temporal consistency when editing videos
- We generate 8 frames with 512x512 resolution for each video
- We use codebase from Stable Diffusion, ControlNet, Dream-Booth, and Instruct Pix2Pix

### Qualitative results
- Text2Video-Zero successfully generates videos with consistent backgrounds and foreground objects
- Text2Video-Zero generates high-quality videos that match the text prompt
- Additional guidance from edges or poses can generate high quality videos with temporal consistency and identity preservation
- Video Instruct-Pix2Pix generates videos with high fidelity to the input video

### Comparison with baselines
- Compared method to two publicly available baselines: CogVideo and Tune-A-Video
- Evaluated CLIP score to compare results
- Our method outperformed CogVideo
- Our method showed better text-video alignment than CogVideo
- Our method showed better temporal consistency and preserved identity of object and background

### Ablation study
- Making the initial latent codes coherent to a motion improves temporal consistency
- Using cross-frame attention on the first frame instead of self-attention further improves temporal consistency

## Conclusion
- Addressed the problem of zero-shot text-to-video synthesis
- Proposed a novel method for time-consistent video generation
- Does not require optimization or fine-tuning
- Demonstrated effectiveness for various applications
- Presented a new problem of zero-shot text-to-video synthesis
- Utilized text-to-image diffusion models for generating time-consistent videos
- Proposed attention modification for consistent style and scene
- Proposed motion latent approach for plausible motions
- Compared to state-of-the-art competitor CogVideo
- Ablation studies on background smoothing, cross-frame attention, latent motion and number of DDPM forward steps

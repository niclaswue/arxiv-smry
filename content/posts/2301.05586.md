# Abstract
- YOLO community has released two versions of YOLOv6
- YOLOv6 v3.0 has been released for Chinese New Year 2023
- YOLOv6-N has 37.5% AP on COCO dataset at 1187 FPS
- YOLOv6-S outperforms other mainstream detectors at same scale
- YOLOv6-M/L have better accuracy performance than other detectors
- YOLOv6-L6 has state-of-the-art accuracy in real-time
- Code is available on GitHub

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- YOLO series is popular for its balance between speed and accuracy
- YOLOv4 reorganized the detection framework into several parts
- YOLOv6 has a Concatenation (BiC) module, a SimCSPSPPF Block, an anchor-aided training (AAT) strategy, a deeper backbone and neck, and a self-distillation strategy

## Method

### Network design
- BiC module applied to top-down pathway of PAN brings AP improvements on YOLOv6-S/L
- BiC module not applied to bottom-up pathway due to confusion for detection heads
- BiC module gives impressive boost to performance of small object detection
- Different types of SPP Blocks explored, SimCSPSPPF blocks introduced for better accuracy-efficiency trade-off

### Anchor-aided training
- AAT brings 0.3-0.5% AP gain for YOLOv6-S/M/L
- Accuracy performance on small objects is significantly enhanced for YOLOv6-N/S/M
- Performance on large objects is improved for YOLOv6-L

### Self-distillation
- Self-distillation method was verified on YOLOv6-L
- Doubling the training epochs did not improve performance
- Weight decay strategy improved performance by 0.6% AP
- DLD specifically designed for small models was tested on YOLOv6-S
- DLD gave 0.7% AP boost and was 0.5% better than doubling the training epochs

## Experiments

### Comparisons
- Evaluation of YOLOv6 compared to YOLOv5, YOLOX, PPYOLOE, YOLOv7 and YOLOv8
- YOLOv6-N has 9.5%/4.2% higher performance than YOLOv5-N/YOLOv7-Tiny
- YOLOv6-S has 3.5%/0.9% higher performance than YOLOX-S/PPYOLOE-S
- YOLOv6-M has 4.6% higher performance than YOLOv5-M
- YOLOv6-L has 3.1%/1.4% higher performance than YOLOX-L/PPYOLOE-L
- YOLOv6 has similar performance to YOLOv8 with better throughput
- YOLOv6-L6 has 0.4% higher performance than YOLOv7-E6E and runs 63% faster

### Ablation study
- Network with BiC and SimCSPSPPF improved AP by 0.6%
- Accuracy improved by 0.3% with AAT and 0.7% with DLD

## Conclusion
- YOLOv6 is upgraded to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy for real-time object detection
- Latency and throughput of all models measured on NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU with TensorRT version 7.2.1.6
- Latency and throughput of all models measured on V100 GPU
- YOLOv6 models equipped with BiC modules
- Ablation studies conducted on YOLOv6-N, YOLOv6-S, YOLOv6-L
- YOLO-series comparison of latency and throughput on T4 and V100 GPUs, and on a typical CPU

# Abstract
- Common myths and legends exist among members of the high-performance computing community.
- These myths are based on evidence or argumentation, not scientific facts.
- These myths can be used to discuss possible new directions for research and industry investment.

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Human society has myths and legends, including in the HPC community
- HPC drives powerful computers and technologies forward
- AI language models cannot create or share fictional content
- 12 myths about HPC are discussed
- Myth 1: Quantum Computing will take over HPC
- Myth 2: Everything will be Deep Learning
- Myth 3: Extreme specialization as seen in smartphones will push supercomputers beyond Moore's Law
- AI is now in the palm of everyone's hand
- GPUs have been successful in HPC
- Multitudes of hardware customization per each facet of the workload is not likely to be successful
- Amdahl's Law limits potential speedup
- Weak scaling is important for modern supercomputers
- Load balancing is difficult with heterogeneous accelerators
- Dark silicon is becoming increasingly difficult to utilize
- Plethora of accelerators is only beneficial for small programs on small machines

## Conclusions
- Debates myths in HPC community
- Many myths form core of thinking
- Some points may settle in the future, others may not
- Serious treatment needed to guide future directions for research, industry and government investment

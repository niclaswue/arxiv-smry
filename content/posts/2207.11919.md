# Abstract
- Ground segmentation is essential for various purposes, such as traversable area detection and object recognition
- Some ground segmentation methods require fine-tuning of parameters depending on the surroundings, which is excessively laborious and time-consuming
- Even if the parameters are well adjusted, a partial under-segmentation problem can still emerge, which implies ground segmentation failures in some regions
- Ground segmentation methods typically fail to estimate an appropriate ground plane when the ground is above another structure, such as a retaining wall
- To address these problems, we propose a robust ground segmentation method called Patchwork++, an extension of Patchwork
- Patchwork++ exploits adaptive ground likelihood estimation (A-GLE) to calculate appropriate parameters adaptively based on the previous ground segmentation results
- Moreover, temporal ground revert (TGR) alleviates a partial under-segmentation problem by using the temporary ground property
- Also, region-wise vertical plane fitting (R-VPF) is introduced to segment the ground plane properly even if the ground is elevated with different layers
- Finally, we present reflected noise removal (RNR) to eliminate virtual noise points efficiently based on the 3D LiDAR reflection model. We demonstrate the qualitative and quantitative evaluations using a SemanticKITTI dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/url-kaist/patchwork-plusplus

# Paper Content

## I. INTRODUCTION
- Recently, mobile robots are increasingly being employed to perform specific tasks in diverse and complex environments.
- To accomplish given tasks in various environments, several studies have improved the perception of the surrounding environments using a 3D light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor.
- Among the various algorithms in 3D perception via 3D LiDAR sensors, ground segmentation is one of the essential tasks for 3D perception.
- For example, ground segmentation can be employed in traversable area detection and object clustering.
- As machine learning has been applied to diverse research areas, various learning-based 3D perception methods have been proposed, exhibiting outstanding performance.
- But, unfortunately, there are two inherent potential limitations. First, learning-based methods require point-wise labeling by humans, which is both time-consuming and severely laborious.
- Second, the performance of learningbased ground segmentation can potentially be degraded when employed in scenes different from the training dataset or different sensor configurations.
- Consequently, in this study, we focus on ground segmentation in non-learning-based methods.
- In general, ground segmentation functions as a preceding stage because the ground and non-ground points can be utilized for different purposes.
- For example, non-ground points go through another segmentation stage, which classifies these non-ground points into static and dynamic points.
- However, because ground points can be assumed as being static, the corresponding segmentation is not performed on the ground points.
- Moreover, when ground segmentation is exploited as a preprocessing step, it should satisfy the following three requirements. First, ground segmentation should be sufficiently fast to be employed as a preliminary process for other algorithms such as object clustering. Second, it should ensure little performance perturbation to simultaneously guarantee both precision and recall performance. Third, it should be capable of dealing with uneven outdoor environments.
- However, several ground segmentation methods fail to satisfy these requirements and even exhibit the undersegmentation problem, as represented in Fig. 1(b).
- Although our previous work, Patchwork [1], meets these requirements, it occasionally exhibits a partial under-segmentation problem, as represented in Fig. 1(c).
- These under-segmentation issues usually occur because of two potential reasons. First, some ground segmentation methods are deterministic. Second, there are some situations in which the assumption that the points with low z values are most likely to be considered as the ground points does not hold.
- Consequently, Patchwork++, an advanced version of Patchwork, is proposed to tackle these problems.
- Accordingly, our proposed method becomes more generalized in complex urban environments.
- Our contributions are threefold as follows: • First, adaptive ground likelihood estimation (A-GLE) and temporal ground revert (TGR) are proposed, which provide even fewer false negatives than Patchwork based on the coarse-to-fine strategy that addresses the partial under-segmentation issue.
- Second, two novel outlier rejection modules, i.e., reflected noise removal (RNR) and region-wise vertical plane fitting (R-VPF), are proposed to prevent the situations where our assumption does not hold by rejecting noises or non-ground points.
- Third, our proposed algorithm was evaluated with the SemanticKITTI dataset [12] and experimental evidence corroborates Patchwork++ exhibits promising performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods including Patchwork and shows the fastest speed as well.

## II. RELATED WORKS

## A. Learning-based Ground Segmentation Methods
- Xu et al. proposed RPVNet, which ranks first on the SemanticKITTI leaderboard of semantic segmentation.
- Shen et al. addressed the problem of the capability of segmentation on rough terrains and the efficiency of processing time by introducing the Jump-Convolution-Process, which facilitates the point cloud segmentation by solving the 2D smoothing problem.
- Paigwar et al. proposed GndNet, which estimates the grid-wise ground elevation and segments ground and nonground points using PointNet [4] to encode a pillar feature in each grid.
- As mentioned in Section I, there are several potential limitations in that these methods require humanmade labeling by hands and the performance can be degraded when it comes to unforeseen situations that are not included in the training data.

## B. Conventional Ground Segmentation Methods
- Moosmann et al. proposed a 3D point cloud segmentation method based on the idea of local convexity
- Himmelsbach et al. also proposed a line-based ground segmentation method providing a significantly high speed
- Zermas et al. proposed a fast ground plane fitting (GPF), which utilizes an initial seed extraction suitable for the ground plane estimation based on principal component analysis (PCA)
- Unlike other ground segmentation methods, such as RANSAC, this approach circumvents redundant random iterations, which are severely time-consuming
- As an extension of GPF, Lim et al. proposed a concentric zone-based region-wise ground segmentation with the GLE
- Narksri et al. proposed a RANSAC-based ground segmentation with multiple regions
- Jiménez et al. addressed the issue of local geometric variation of the ground by adopting the channel-based Markov random field
- Although various conventional ground segmentation methods have been proposed, severe problems remain inherent in these methods. In particular, under-segmentation is the representative problem that results in lots of false negatives

## C. Applications of Ground Segmentation
- Ground segmentation is a prior step in object recognition
- Eliminating ground points enhances both computational efficiency and accuracy
- According to the research, a few planar features are extracted from the ground to estimate the transformation in terms of z (height direction), roll angle, and pitch angle

## III. PATCHWORK++: FAST, ROBUST, AND ADAPTIVE GROUND SEGMENTATION
- The problem definition and rationale behind each module of Patchwork++ are highlighted
- The four modules of Patchwork++ are proposed
- The problem with Patchwork is that it is not modular
- The four modules of Patchwork++ are proposed to address this problem

## A. Problem Definition
- Given a 3D point cloud, P, which represents the set of measured points, p, and presents a snapshot of the surroundings, we attempt to classify every pinto the ground, including road, terrain, and sidewalks, or non-ground class, which includes cars, buildings, humans, etc.
- P can be represented as a union of two distinct sets: a set of ground points, G, and non-ground points, N.
- In contrast, a ground segmentation method outputs the estimated ground points, Ĝ, while the remaining points are regarded as a set of nonground points, N.
- Therefore, P can be expressed as follows: Ĝ∩G, Ĝ∩N, N ∩G, and N ∩N represent the set of true positives (T P ), false positives (F P ), false negatives (F N ), and true negatives (T N ), respectively.

## B. RNR: Reflected Noise Removal
- Some noise points are occasionally observed under the actual ground, as illustrated in Fig. 3.
- Unfortunately, R-GPF selects initial seeds based on the assumption that the points at the lowest part in the bin are ground; hence, these noises can be regarded as initial seeds that trigger the under-segmentation problem in the corresponding bin.
- To address this problem, these points are usually filtered out by rejecting points whose z value is smaller than a userdefined threshold, z min.
- This filtering assumes that the ground of surroundings is sufficiently flat.
- Unfortunately, this noise removal method also triggers a severe problem that erases a few true ground points undesirably in steep slope environments, as illustrated in Figs. 4(b) and (c).
- Therefore, it is necessary to discriminate between the actual ground points and noise points.
- To this end, RNR is proposed by leveraging two key observations based on the research by Zhao et al. [25].
- First, the virtual noise points can be obtained by the reflection on the reflective surfaces, i.e., bonnets and roofs of vehicles, or glass.
- This fact lets the noise points be located along the direction from the sensor origin onto the point of incidence, as shown in Fig. 3.
- It is noticeable that the smaller the incident angle, the lower the z value of the noise tends to occur.
- For this reason, it can be concluded that critical noises that hinder our assumption are highly likely to be originated from the rays from the bottom rings because the ray directions of the bottom rings tend to have relatively small incident angles.
- Second, these noise points have relatively small intensities in general because the rays which correspond to the noise points undergo more reflections than the usual rays until they return to the sensor.
- For example, the ray of the virtual point takes additional reflection on the point of incidence, as illustrated in Fig. 3.
- Consequently, this additional reflection triggers the decrease of the intensity of the virtual point.
- Therefore, firstly, RNR only checks a certain number of bottom rings, N noise, to remove these noise points.
- Accordingly, RNR rejects the points that are located in these rings with a lower height than the noise removal height threshold, h noise, and lower intensity than the noise removal intensity threshold, I noise.
- Consequently, RNR efficiently removes noise points with unrealistically large negative z values with a negligible loss of actual ground points.
- In particular, h noise is self-updated by A-GLE (see Section III.D).

## C. R-VPF: Region-wise Vertical Plane Fitting
- R-GPF sometimes fails to estimate an appropriate ground plane in situations where the desired ground is above vertical urban structures
- This is because the points from the vertical structures are chosen as the initial seeds due to their smaller z values compared with actual ground points
- For example, when retaining walls are located under the ground in the bin and close enough to the sensor, R-GPF selects the points from the wall as the initial seeds of the ground.

## Point of incidence
- R-VPF selects some points starting from the lowest point, as seed points in every k-th iteration
- R-VPF estimates the mean of seed points, m k n ∈ R 3 , and the unit normal vector, v k 3,n , which corresponds to the eigenvector with the smallest eigenvalue from the PCA of seed points
- k-th potential vertical plane points, Ŵ k n , are sampled among the candidate points, P k n , as follows: where V i n , otherwise, and d v denotes the distance margin for the estimated vertical plane
- V k n , which denotes the vertical points at the k-th iteration, is determined based on the following condition: where u z denotes the unit normal vector in the z-axis direction, i.e., [0 0 1] and θ v is the margin for the unit normal vector of the estimated plane
- Finally, the total vertical points, Vn , are estimated by accumulating all the vertical points as follows: where K v denotes the number of iterations for R-VPF

## D. A-GLE: Adaptive Ground Likelihood Estimation
- GLE is determined by uprightness, elevation, and flatness indicator functions with v 3,n , zn , and σ n as variables
- In this paper, zn , σ n , κ(r n ), and σ τ,m are represented as e n , f n , e τ,m , and f τ,m for simplicity
- Unless A-GLE is initialized with abnormal values of e τ,m and f τ,m , A-GLE can update these parameters properly

## Vertical plane points

## Ground plane points Estimated ground points
- Estimated ground plane without R-VPF and with R-VPF
- In addition, fn, which is the flatness variable [1] of the estimated plane, becomes smaller.
- Accordingly, the estimated ground can be distinguishable as a ground owing to its small fn.
- Elevation
- For the self-update of parameters, we propose a novel concept of definite ground, D m , which represents the previously estimated ground planes satisfying uprightness and elevation conditions in the m-th ring of the concentric zone model. Accordingly, A-GLE adopts the properties of definite ground planes to update the elevation parameter for the next estimation.
- Let E m be the set of all e n values of estimated ground planes in D m .
- Then, based on E m , e τ,m is newly updated as follows: where mean(•) and stdev(•) denote the mean and standard deviation of a given set, respectively.
- a m > 0 denotes the constant gain of the standard deviation term in the m-th ring of the concentric zone model for elevation.
- Flatness
- Before updating the flatness parameter f τ,m , it is found that a potential problem exists in its calculation in our previous work. Specifically, as mentioned above, f n was calculated as λ3,n λ1,n+λ2,n+λ3,n . To obtain a meaningful value from this approach, the value must be consistent for the same ground regardless of the ground's relative LiDAR position.
- Unfortunately, because Patchwork leverages the concentric zone model, the ground is divided into several bins with the sensor origin as the center. Accordingly, the shape and size of the ground can be differentiated by the approach taken to divide the ground.
- Then, λ 1,n and λ 2,n can be changed even though the overall ground does not change. Therefore, one can argue that f n calculated accordingly is illogical based on its potential inconsistency.
- To address this problem, Patchwork++ sets f n = λ 3,n , which is a variation in the surface normal direction.
- Similar to e τ,m , f τ,m has been updated based on the distribution of D m by A-GLE.
- Let F m be the set of all f n for the estimated ground planes in D m .
- Then, f τ,m can be updated as follows: where δ < 0 means the distance margin of the noise removal.

## E. TGR: Temporal Ground Revert
- A-GLE is able to estimate the typical ground points within a bin
- However, some unusual ground points within a bin do not satisfy the parameters' condition
- For example, rough terrains with grass sometimes have higher en and f n than the selfupdated parameters
- This is because A-GLE updates its parameters based on all values over time
- Accordingly, this makes A-GLE play a role as a low-pass filter, which makes it difficult to estimate the bin as ground when f n becomes temporarily large
- To address this problem, TGR is proposed to revert the under-segmented ground planes into the segmented ground bins using the D t m , which are definite ground planes only at time t

## 3D Point Cloud

## IV. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

## A. Dataset and Error Metrics
- The SemanticKITTI dataset was adopted
- Based on the point-wise labels, the points labeled as road, parking, sidewalk, other ground, lane marking, and terrain are considered ground points.
- The other points are regarded as non-ground points.
- However, unlike our previous work [1], the points labeled as vegetation are not evaluated as ground nor nonground exceptionally because it is impractical to regard the vegetation as a single ground or non-ground class.
- Note that this implies that points labeled as vegetation are only excluded in the evaluation step; the points are still included in the input point cloud.

## B. Parameters of Patchwork++
- We set initial e τ,m and f τ,m both 0 for all m (1 ≤ m ≤ 4).
- The other parameters are identical to our previous work [1].
- For RNR, we set N noise = 20 and I noise = 0.2.
- For R-VPF, we set d v = 0.1, θ v = 0.707, and K v = 3.

## V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

## A. Comparison with the State-of-the-Art Methods
- The proposed method exhibits the highest F1 score compared with other ground segmentation methods
- The proposed method addresses the inherent problem of the previous noise filtering method
- The novel Patchwork++ presents a lower standard deviation of recall

## B. Effect of R-VPF
- R-VPF allows R-GPF to estimate correct ground planes even though the ground points are located on a low fence or flower bed.
- R-GPF is strongly based on the premise that the bottom points are likely to be ground points; hence, R-GPF without R-VPF occasionally leads to lots of FN.
- In contrast, R-GPF with R-VPF exhibits a successful ground segmentation by extracting points from the fence as nonground points in advance.

## C. Effect of A-GLE
- The green points represent D m and approximately 95.8% of them are true ground based on the Se-manticKITTI dataset [12].
- As the green points are determined by the self-updated e τ,m , this verifies that the resultant e τ,m is sufficiently valid to estimate usual grounds and yields the appropriate D m .
- Moreover, as 85.3% of the true ground points are included in the green points, it is reasonable to update f τ,m based on D m , which classifies the blue and red points in Fig. 10.
- Similarly, the resultant f τ,m , which is drawn as a horizontal black-dotted line in Fig. 10, appears to be suited to distinguish blue and red points, which can be assumed as ground and non-ground, respectively.

## Ground points
- The self-updated f τ,m is sufficiently valid to distinguish ground planes from non-ground planes.
- The self-updated f τ,m is a sufficient condition for the validity of the ground-plane detection algorithm.

## D. Effect of TGR
- Next, experimental evidences support that TGR resolves the partial under-segmentation issue
- Specifically, even though some bins have larger f n than f τ,m in ( 6), these are double-checked based on the distribution characteristics of the currently estimated ground planes at time t
- Therefore, TGR significantly reverts numerous FNs into TPs
- Accordingly, TGR increases the recall with a negligible decrease in precision

## E. Different Distributions of Self-Updated Parameters Depending on the Surroundings
- The self-updated parameters have different aspects depending on the surroundings
- The sorting step in the currently proposed method is performed after the division of the point cloud into CZM, which can be approximated by O(LM log M ), where L and M denote the number of bins and the number of points within each bin, respectively
- Consequently, the bin-wise sorting can reduce the complexity by LM log L

- 15.43 R-GPF: The 15.43 R-GPF is the relative error of the speed method.
- 35.30 CascadedSeg: The 35.30 CascadedSeg is the number of cascaded segments that the speed method uses.
- 13.07 Patchwork: The 13.07 Patchwork is the number of patches that the speed method uses.

# Abstract
- Ground segmentation is an essential task for 3D perception using 3D LiDAR sensors.
- Several ground segmentation methods have been proposed, but they have some limitations.
- Patchwork++ is a robust ground segmentation method that addresses these limitations.
- Patchwork++ uses adaptive ground likelihood estimation, temporal ground revert, region-wise vertical plane fitting, and reflected noise removal.

## I. introduction
- Mobile robots are increasingly being used to perform tasks in complex environments
- 3D LiDAR sensors are used for detection, segmentation, localization, and 3D registration
- Ground segmentation is an essential task for 3D perception
- Machine learning has been applied to 3D perception
- Potential limitations of learning-based methods include time-consuming labeling and degraded performance in different scenes

## Iii. patchwork++: fast, robust, and adaptive ground segmentation
- Problem definition and rationale behind Patchwork++
- Four parts proposed: RNR, R-VPF, A-GLE, and TGR

## A. problem definition
- Attempt to classify 3D point cloud into ground and non-ground classes
- Ground segmentation method outputs estimated ground points
- Actual ground points and non-ground points can be divided into true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true negatives
- Objective is to estimate ground points with as many true positives as possible while rejecting false negatives and false positives

## B. rnr: reflected noise removal
- Noise points can be observed in raw point clouds
- R-GPF can select initial seeds that trigger under-segmentation
- Points with z value smaller than a user-defined threshold are filtered out
- This can erase true ground points in steep slope environments
- RNR leverages two key observations to discriminate between actual ground points and noise points
- RNR rejects points with lower height and intensity than thresholds to remove noise points

## C. r-vpf: region-wise vertical plane fitting
- R-GPF sometimes fails to estimate an appropriate ground plane when the desired ground is above vertical urban structures.
- This is because the points from the vertical structures have smaller z values than the actual ground points, so they are chosen as the initial seeds.
- PCA-based estimation is sensitive to outlier points, which can lead to an unsuitable ground fitting result.

## Point of incidence
- Elevated ground should be considered as non-ground
- Dynamic objects, such as humans, can still stand on that ground
- R-VPF proposed to estimate more accurate ground planes
- Points divided into multiple subsets in the polar coordinate
- R-VPF selects seed points and estimates mean and unit normal vector
- Points considered as vertical points in previous iterations are rejected in subsequent iterations
- Total vertical points are estimated by accumulating all the vertical points

## D. a-gle: adaptive ground likelihood estimation
- Previous work used GLE to determine ground or non-ground
- GLE determined by uprightness, elevation, and flatness indicator functions
- Parameters need to be set depending on the environment
- A-GLE updates parameters and noise removal height threshold in an adaptive manner

## Vertical plane points

## Ground plane points estimated ground points
- R-VPF is applied for preprocessing to accurately estimate the ground plane
- A novel concept of definite ground is proposed to update parameters
- Elevation parameter is updated based on the set of estimated ground planes
- Flatness parameter is updated based on the set of estimated ground planes
- A-GLE stores the states from the previously estimated ground and updates parameters for the next estimation

## E. tgr: temporal ground revert
- A-GLE is used to estimate typical ground points.
- Unusual ground points may not satisfy the parameters' condition.
- A-GLE acts as a low-pass filter, making it difficult to estimate the bin as ground.
- TGR is proposed to revert the under-segmented ground planes into the segmented ground bins.
- TGR compares each under-segmented bin's f n with f t τ,m.

## 3d point cloud

## Iv. experimental setup

## A. dataset and error metrics
- Experiments conducted using SemanticKITTI dataset
- Ground points include road, parking, sidewalk, other ground, lane marking, and terrain
- Points labeled as vegetation excluded from evaluation, but still included in input point cloud
- Error metrics used are precision, recall, and F1 score

## B. parameters of patchwork++
- Set initial e τ,m and f τ,m to 0 for all m (1 ≤ m ≤ 4)
- Parameters identical to previous work [1]
- For RNR, set N noise = 20 and I noise = 0.2
- For R-VPF, set d v = 0.1, θ v = 0.707, and K v = 3

## V. results and discussion

## A. comparison with the state-of-the-art methods
- Proposed algorithm has highest F1 score compared to other ground segmentation methods
- Addresses noise filtering, unsuitable definition of f n, and partial under-segmentation issues
- Higher precision and recall than Patchwork, lower standard deviation of recall

## B. effect of r-vpf
- R-VPF allows R-GPF to estimate correct ground planes.
- R-GPF without R-VPF occasionally leads to lots of false negatives.
- R-GPF with R-VPF successfully segments ground by extracting points from the fence as nonground points.

## C. effect of a-gle
- Approximately 95.8% of the green points represent true ground based on the SemanticKITTI dataset.
- 85.3% of the true ground points are included in the green points.
- The black-dotted line in Fig. 10 is used to distinguish between ground and non-ground points.

## Ground points
- Non-ground points represent other points
- Self-updated f τ,m is valid for distinguishing ground planes from non-ground planes

## D. effect of tgr
- TGR resolves partial under-segmentation issue
- TGR increases recall with a small decrease in precision

## E. different distributions of self-updated parameters depending on the surroundings
- Self-updated parameters have different aspects depending on the surroundings
- In highway scenarios, parameters are set to small values
- In country scenarios, parameters are set to higher values
- Algorithm is faster than Patchwork

## Method
- Speed Method Speed LineFit had a speed of 58.96
- GPF had a speed of 29.72
- RANSAC had a speed of 15.43
- R-GPF had a speed of 35.30
- CascadedSeg had a speed of 13.07
- Patchwork had a speed of 43.97

## Vi. conclusion

- Patchwork++ reduces the number of parameters that need to be fine-tuned
- Patchwork++ will be used for various applications in the future

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Deep learning is a subfield of AI
- Uses multi-layer neural networks
- Used to advance mathematics, investigate galaxies, and generate realistic images
- Chemistry and biology have seen AI breakthroughs in protein structure prediction, chemical synthesis planning, and atomistic simulations
- Drug discovery has benefited from deep learning
- Deep learning can accelerate navigation of chemical space of drug-like molecules
- Most deep learning studies have focused on ligand-based approaches
- Structure-based deep learning approaches have not found parallel interest yet
- Deep learning can help address existing drug discovery challenges
- Deep learning does not require explicit feature engineering
- Accurate protein structure prediction efforts can accelerate computer-assisted SBDD
- Deep learning for SBDD is still in its infancy but is moving forward quickly

## Representing proteins for deep learning
- Deep learning approaches for SBDD are more intricate than ligand-based approaches.
- Proteins have 3 levels of complexity: primary, secondary and tertiary structure.
- Protein representations used for deep learning include primary sequence and tertiary structure.

### Box 1: glossary of selected terms
- Binding site: Protein region responsible for interaction with other molecules
- Convolutional neural network (CNN): Neural network architecture that learns from local information
- Molecular docking: Computational procedure used to predict binding mode of molecule
- Generative deep learning: Deep learning methods that model data distribution and generate new data points
- Geometric deep learning: Neural network architectures that incorporate symmetry information
- Molecular descriptors: Numerical features obtained from molecular representation
- Ligand: Molecule that binds to protein with high affinity and specificity
- Reinforcement learning: Machine learning that maximizes cumulative reward in environment
- SMILES: Representation of small molecule ligands
- Protein surface: Separation between solvent-accessible and inaccessible regions

## Deep learning for structure-based drug discovery
- SBDD approaches fueled by deep learning are discussed
- Three key tasks are focused on: binding site detection, drug-target interaction prediction, and structure-based de novo design
- Protein representation used includes sequence, structure, and surface

### Drug-target interaction prediction
- Predicting interaction between proteins and ligands
- Amino-acid sequence and 3D structure used to predict protein structures
- AlphaFold v 2.0 used to predict 2,316 structures
- AlphaFill used to transplant common ligands and cofactors
- Binding MOAD used to predict X-ray crystal structures with bound ligands and experimental binding affinities
- DUD-E used to benchmark molecular docking programs
- BindingDB used to validate sets of protein-ligand pairs
- BigBind used to associate protein structures to ChEMBL assay data
- KIBA used to measure bioactivity of compounds against kinases
- Davis used to measure binding affinities of inhibitors against kinases
- 3D structure-based and surface-based approaches used to predict binding affinity
- Deep learning used to optimize ligand pose and predict binding pose

### Binding site detection
- Identification of 'druggable' binding sites in proteins is important for SBDD
- Several methods have been developed for binding site detection
- Deep learning methods have been used to detect binding sites
- Sequence-based models use AI to highlight relevant residues
- 3D structure-based models use spatial information of proteins
- Surface-based models use protein surfaces
- De novo design generates novel chemical entities
- Sequence-based de novo design uses machine translation
- 3D structure-based de novo design generates 3D molecular graphs or strings
- Structure-based de novo design has not been applied prospectively

### Box 2: simplified depiction of common neural networks applied to protein representations.
- Protein representations are suited to different neural network architectures
- RNNs are used to process protein primary sequences and capture long-range dependencies
- CNNs are used with voxelized representations to capture spatial dependencies
- GNNs operate on molecular graphs and can capture structural and functional relationships

## Gaps, opportunities, and outlook
- Deep learning for structure-based drug discovery is gaining traction
- Protein structure prediction is an example of the potential of deep learning
- SBDD is more challenging than ligand-based counterpart
- Geometric deep learning and diffusion models are gaining popularity
- Training data is limited and biased
- Deep learning is met with skepticism by experimentalists
- Need to validate methods experimentally and use explainable AI

## Conclusions
- Deep learning has been used in drug discovery to explore chemical space.
- It can be used for ligand binding site detection, drug-target interaction prediction, and structure-based de novo design.
- Data collection and curation is needed to overcome barriers in structure-based methods.

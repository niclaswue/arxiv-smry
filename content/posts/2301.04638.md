# Abstract
- Navier-Stokes equations are dissipative, meaning the long-time dynamics of a flow can be described in a low-dimensional coordinate system.
- Data-driven manifold dynamics modeling method can be used to describe the dynamics of turbulent Couette flow.
- Autoencoder used to find low-dimensional manifold coordinate system and neural network used to define ordinary differential equations.
- Models with fewer than 20 degrees of freedom can capture key characteristics of the flow.
- Models outperform POD-Galerkin models with 2000 degrees of freedom.
- Unstable periodic orbits computed from the models, some of which correspond to previously unknown solutions.

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Major challenge in dealing with chaotic fluid flows is high-dimensional nature of the state
- Dissipative nature of turbulent flows leads to expectation that long-time dynamics collapse onto an invariant manifold of much lower dimension
- Modeling dynamics in a manifold coordinate system can speed up computations and be useful for downstream tasks
- Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is a linear dimension reduction technique
- POD has been used for many flow phenomena
- Nonlinear methods can be used for more accurate reconstruction
- Autoencoders can be used with equations of motion in manifold Galerkin approach
- Machine learning techniques can be used to approximate dynamics
- Neural ordinary differential equations (ODE) can be used to model chaotic dynamics
- Aim is to use data-driven model to reconstruct turbulent plane Couette flow
- Self-sustaining process (SSP) of wall bounded turbulence outlined by Hamilton et al. (1995)
- Low-dimensional models have been developed to recreate the dynamics of the SSP
- Data-driven models have been used to attempt to reconstruct the MFE model dynamics
- Key approach to understanding complex nonlinear dynamical phenomena is through study of underlying state space structure of fixed points and periodic orbits
- Data-driven Manifold Dynamics (DManD) used to build a ROM for turbulent MFU PCF

## Framework
- DManD modeling approach allows for perfect reconstruction
- Training data is full-state data in an ambient space
- Mapping to low-dimensional state representation with ℎ
- Mapping back to full state with hybrid autoencoder
- Autoencoder trained by minimizing mean-squared error and promoting accurate representation of POD coefficients
- Evolution of trajectories on manifold performed in manifold coordinates
- Approximate  with neural ODE and linear damping term
- Determine parameters by minimizing difference between predicted and true state
- Preprocessing step to split state into pattern and phase
- Evolution of pattern and phase only depend on pattern
- Additional ODE for phase
- Determine parameters of phase ODE by minimizing difference between predicted and true phase

## Results

### Description of plane couette flow data
- Applied DManD to DNS of turbulent PCF in a MFU domain
- Considered the well-studied Hamilton, Kim, and Waleffe (HKW) domain
- Compared DManD results to analysis of self-sustaining process in this domain
- Compared DManD results to other Galerkin-based ROMs
- Compared DManD results to known unstable periodic solutions in this domain
- Solved Navier-Stokes equations for fluid confined between two plates moving in opposite directions
- Selected HKW cell because it is well studied and isolates the SSP
- Generated turbulent PCF trajectories using psuedo-spectral Channelflow code
- Split data into 80% for training and 20% for testing
- Preprocessed data by computing mean u and subtracting it from all data

### Dimension reduction and dynamic model construction
- Linear dimension reduction with POD reduces the dimension from O (10 5 ) to 502
- POD modes are treated as Fourier modes in both the  and  directions
- 256 POD modes contain 99.8% of the energy
- Autoencoders are used to reduce the dimension down to  ℎ
- Autoencoders perform an order magnitude better than POD
- Stabilized neural ODEs are trained to predict the evolution of the centered data
- NN is trained with an Adam optimizer and learning rate scheduler

### Short-time tracking
- DManD models are evaluated for reconstructing short-time trajectories and long-time statistics
- DManD captures key characteristics of the SSP (low-speed streaks become wavy, rolls lift fluid from the walls, regenerating streaks)
- Quantitative agreement between DNS and DManD
- Modal root-mean squared velocity used to identify different parts of the SSP
- Tracking error of 10 trajectories shown in Fig. 5
- Normalized ensemble-averaged tracking error for model dimensions between 3 and 18
- Instantaneous kinetic energy of the flow is considered
- ODE trained for phase dynamics
- Mean squared phase displacement in good agreement between DNS and model

### Long-time statistics
- DManD model uses stabilized neural ODEs with an explicit damping term to capture long-time dynamics
- Without damping, almost all models become unstable for ℎ = 5-16, and around half become unstable in other cases
- DManD model with 18 degrees of freedom matches mean-squared amplitudes to high accuracy
- For ℎ = 2 and 3, nearly all models match the data, with small deviations for ℎ ∼ 3-6
- For ℎ = 2 and 2, deviation becomes more obvious, and lines do not converge until around ℎ > 10
- With ℎ = 6, model overestimates number of low dissipation states, while ℎ = 18 matches density well
- EMD steeply drops at ℎ = 5 and after ℎ > 10 joint PDFs are in excellent agreement with DNS

### Finding ecs in the model
- DManD model can quantitatively capture key characteristics of MFU PCF
- Investigating whether known periodic orbits of DNS exist in DManD model
- Using DManD model to search for new periodic orbits
- Periodic orbits of DManD model are either periodic or relative periodic orbits
- Outline approach to find periodic orbits follows Cvitanović et al. (2016)
- Equivalent to finding zeros of (3.16)
- Use Newton-Raphson method to find zeros
- Compute Jacobian of (ℎ) from Eq. 2.9
- Use Scipy "hybr" method to find periodic orbits of DManD model
- Use Newton GMRES-Hookstep method to find periodic orbits of DNS
- Found 9 new RPOs and 3 existing POs
- New method to rapidly find new ECS using accurate low-dimensional model

## Conclusion
- Data-driven manifold dynamics method (DManD) used to model MFU PCF with fewer degrees of freedom than required for DNS
- Hybrid autoencoder approach used to find low-dimensional parameterization of manifold
- Stabilized neural ODEs used to accurately evolve low-dimensional state forward in time
- DManD model captures self-sustaining process and accurately tracks trajectories and temporal autocorrelation
- POD-Galerkin model requires 2000 degrees of freedom to match mean-squared POD coefficient amplitudes
- DManD model used for PO searches, successfully landed on nearby POs and found 9 previously undiscovered RPOs
- True dimension of turbulent flow dynamics can be orders of magnitude smaller than degrees of freedom required for fully-resolved simulation
- DManD model enables model-based nonlinear control algorithms to be used

# Abstract
- Diffusion models are popular for their generative capabilities
- Existing inversion methods focus on capturing object appearances, not relations
- Propose ReVersion for relation inversion task, which learns relation prompt from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model
- Preposition prior used to sparsely activate relation prompt
- Relation-steering contrastive learning scheme to capture interactions between objects and disentangle from object appearances
- ReVersion Benchmark provides exemplar images with diverse relations

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Study of new problem, Relation Inversion
- Existing T2I inversion methods mainly focus on capturing appearances
- Propose ReVersion framework
- Relation-steering contrastive learning scheme steers relation prompt using preposition prior
- Relation-focal importance sampling emphasizes high-level relations over low-level details
- Contribute ReVersion Benchmark as diagnostic and benchmarking tool

## Related work
- Diffusion models are a mainstream approach for image synthesis
- Diffusion models have been used in various domains such as video generation, image restoration, etc.
- Relation modeling has been explored in discriminative tasks such as scene graph generation and visual relationship detection
- Diffusion-based inversion aims to find a text embedding vector to express the concepts in given exemplar images

## The relation inversion task
- Relation Inversion extracts a common relation R from a set of exemplar images.
- Each exemplar image contains two dominant entities.
- The entities interact with each other through the common relation R.
- The objective is to optimize the relation prompt R.
- Relation Inversion can be used for relation-specific text-to-image synthesis.
- It could potentially inspire future research in representation learning, fewshot learning, visual relation detection, scene graph generation, and more.

## The reversion framework

### Preliminaries
- Diffusion models are generative models that denoise a Gaussian prior to the data
- Training objective is to predict the added noise
- Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) models images' projections in autoencoder's compressed latent space and enables text-to-image generation
- Stable Diffusion extends LDM by training on larger dataset and changing the trainable BERT text encoder
- Aim is to capture object relations by finding a relation prompt given several exemplar images

### Preposition prior
- Appearance inversion focuses on inverting low-level features of a specific entity.
- Pixel-level reconstruction loss is used to capture shared information in exemplar images.
- Preposition prior is a language-based prior used to represent relations.
- Prepositions describe relations in natural language.

### Relation-steering contrastive learning
- Goal is to acquire a relation prompt R that accurately captures the co-existing relation in the exemplar images
- Reconstruction loss mainly focuses on low-level reconstruction rather than visual relations
- Preposition prior is used as guidance to steer the relation prompt towards the relation-dense text embedding subspace
- Object descriptions of exemplar images are used as improved negative set
- Noise-robust contrastive loss is used as final steering loss

### Relation-focal importance sampling
- Sampling process of diffusion models emphasizes high-level semantics first and fine details later.
- Objective is to capture high-level concept in exemplar images, so low-level details should not be emphasized.
- Importance sampling strategy is used to encourage learning of high-level relations.
- Sampling distribution is skewed so that higher probability is assigned to larger t.

## The reversion benchmark
- 10 representative object relations with different abstraction levels
- Wide range of entities involved
- 4-10 exemplar images for each relation
- Text templates for each exemplar image
- 100 inference templates for each of the 10 relations

## Experiments
- Used Stable Diffusion for experiments
- Generated images at 512 x 512 resolution

### Comparison methods
- Used Stable Diffusion 1.5 as text-to-image generation baseline
- Used natural language to describe the relation in each set of exemplar images
- Used Textual Inversion on Stable Diffusion 1.5
- Tuned learning rate and batch size for optimal performance on Relation Inversion task

### Qualitative comparisons
- Generated entities in inference template
- Entities follow relation in exemplar images
- Compared to text-to-image generation and Textual Inversion
- Text-to-image generation relies on bias between entities
- ReVersion alleviates this problem
- Textual Inversion leaks entities from exemplar images

### Quantitative comparisons
- Conducted user study with 37 human evaluators
- Sampled 20 groups of images with 3 images generated by different methods
- Exemplar images and text description of the exemplar images presented
- Evaluators asked to vote for best generated image based on Entity Accuracy

### Ablation study
- Removing steering or importance sampling results in worse accuracy
- Relation-steering guides R towards the relation-dense "preposition prior" and away from exemplar entities
- Importance sampling emphasizes high-level relations over low-level details

## Conclusion
- Proposed Relation Inversion task which aims to learn a relation prompt to capture the relation that co-exists in multiple exemplar images
- Relation-steering contrastive learning scheme to guide the relation prompt towards relation-dense regions in the text embedding space
- Contributed ReVersion Benchmark for performance evaluation
- Potential applications in generative model inversion, representation learning, few-shot learning, visual relation detection, and scene graph generation
- Limitations: performance dependent on generative capabilities of Stable Diffusion, might produce suboptimal synthesis results for entities that Stable Diffusion struggles with
- Potential Negative Societal Impacts: entity relational composition capabilities of ReVersion could be applied maliciously on real human figures
- Experimental comparison results and analysis
- Devised objective evaluation metric to measure the quality and accuracy of the inverted relation
- Calculated Relation Accuracy Score as the percentage of generated images that follow the relation class in the exemplar images
- Calculated Entity Accuracy Score as the CLIP score between the generated image and the revised text prompt
- Compared with text-to-image generation, Textual Inversion, and DreamBooth
- ReVersion Benchmark contains ten diverse and representative object relations
- 100 inference templates for each relation
- 1,000 synthesized images for each inverted R
- Advised users to only use ReVersion for proper recreational purposes
- Rapid advancement of generative models has unlocked new levels of creativity but has also introduced various societal concerns
- Used pre-trained Stable Diffusion for ReVersion, which has been shown to suffer from data bias in certain scenarios

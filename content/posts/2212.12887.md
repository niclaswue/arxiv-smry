# Abstract
- Efficient and robust control using spiking neural networks (SNNs) is still an
- Whilst behaviour of biological agents is produced through sparse and irregular spiking patterns, which provide both robust and efficient control, the activity patterns in most artificial spiking neural networks used for control are dense and regular -- resulting in potentially less efficient codes.
- Additionally, for most existing control solutions network training or optimization is necessary, even for fully identified systems, complicating their implementation in on-chip low-power solutions.
- The neuroscience theory of Spike Coding Networks (SCNs) offers a fully analytical solution for implementing dynamical systems in recurrent spiking neural networks -- while maintaining irregular, sparse, and robust spiking activity -- but it's not clear how to directly apply it to control problems.
- Here, we extend SCN theory by incorporating closed-form optimal estimation and control. The resulting networks work as a spiking equivalent of a linear-quadratic-Gaussian controller.
- We demonstrate robust spiking control of simulated spring-mass-damper and cart-pole systems, in the face of several perturbations, including input- and system-noise, system disturbances, and neural silencing.
- As our approach does not need learning or optimization, it offers opportunities for deploying fast and efficient task-specific on-chip spiking controllers with biologically realistic activity.

# Paper Content

## I. INTRODUCTION
- The activity of complex networks of neurons is strongly linked to the capacity of biological agents to move and interact in the world.
- SNNs are experiencing a qualitative improvement in recent years driven by neuromorphic hardware and learning algorithms developments.
- Analytical solutions are desirable for control, as they are interpretable, have the advantage of being well-applicable to identified systems, are quick and efficient to implement and deploy, and they are amendable to theoretical explorations of stability and function.
- In control theory, such fully analytical solutions are often possible, but are difficult to directly implement in SNNs due to their highly nonlinear and discontinuous nature.
- Second, biological spiking codes are generally highly irregular and sparse.
- In contrast, SNN-based control solutions often produce and require highly dense and regular activity (e.g., [12], [13]), and are hence inefficient.
- How we can reconcile precise and efficient control with a more biological irregular spiking code is an open problem.
- While spiking irregularity is usually considered a consequence of noise, according to the neuroscience theory of spike coding networks (SCNs) it could also be a signature of a highly precise spiking code.
- SCN theory follows a similar principle as the theory of predictive coding. Neurons only fire when the network's prediction error exceeds a threshold value, efficiently constraining this error.
- The resulting neural spiking activity is 'coordinated' across the neuron population, producing sparse and irregular patterns.
- SCNs have the great advantage that they are defined analyticallythrough a closed-form solution for the recurrent connectivity. They thus have the potential to solve both above challenges.
- However, while the SCN framework permits us to analytically implement [15], [18] or learn [19]- [21] any dynamical system, it is an open problem how they can be used to both estimate and control the state of an external system.

## A. Contribution
- We mathematically formalize the link between optimal control of dynamical systems and the SCN framework.
- Specifically, we analytically derive the spiking equivalent of the linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control problem -the combination of a linear quadratic estimator (Kalman filter) and a linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) controller (Fig. 2B  and C).
- We show that our proposed networks (i) accurately estimate and control well-known dynamical systems, achieving similar performance as their non-spiking counterpart, and, importantly, (ii) they preserve the irregular and sparse spiking patterns and robustness to neuron death.

## II. METHODS

## A. The spiking control problem
- We have a system with state x(t) we would like to control with a spiking signal (s(t)) emitted from a recurrent SNN
- The SNN is provided with some incomplete measurements of the system state y(t) and a target state z(t), and has to generate a control signal u(t)
- The spiking patterns are generated according to some underlying voltage dynamics
- There are many such models of varying complexities, but for most practical applications networks of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons suffice
- A network of N such neurons is then defined by v(t) = −λv(t) + Fc(t) + Ω s r(t) + Ω f s(t) + η v , where v(t) ∈ R N is the vector of neural voltages, F ∈ R K×N are some input weights, c(t) ∈ R K is some K-dimensional input, s(t) ∈ R N are the emitted spikes, r(t) ∈ R N are the filtered spike-trains 1 , and η v ∈ R N corresponds to independent voltage noise.
- Finally, there are fast synapses which affect the post-synaptic voltage instantaneously following a spike (through fast recurrent connections Ω f ∈ R N ×N ), and slow synapses which cause an initially slow change in voltage (through the slow recurrent connections Ω s ∈ R N ×N ).
- Whenever a given neuron's voltage v i reaches a threshold T i , that neuron will emit a spike at that time (resulting in spiketrains s i (t) = j δ(t − t j )).
- The voltage will then be reset to some resting value (here implemented through the diagonal elements of Ω).
- How should the recurrent and input weights of the network be set, such that the output signal is as optimal as possible?
- One solution is to train the network using a cost function that enforces, for instance, sparsity.

## B. Spike-coding network theory
- Identification of dynamical systems
- Optimal estimation of dynamical systems through Kalman filtering
- Optimal estimation and control of dynamical systems through Kalman filtering combined with an LQR controller
- Proposed in [15]

## III. CLOSED-FORM OPTIMAL ESTIMATION AND CONTROL
- SCNs can implement dynamical systems
- This framework allows for the implementation of classical control in SNNs
- This allows for the simultaneous act of state estimation and control

## A. The classical control problem
- Consider a K-dimensional linear dynamical system in statespace representation
- where x(t) is the state vector, A is the system matrix, u(t) is the input vector, and B is the input matrix
- η d is a reflection of internal disturbances, given by a zero-mean Gaussian process with covariance Σ d
- y(t) is an observation about x(t), and C is the observability matrix
- η n is sensor noise, given by a zero-mean Gaussian process with co-variance Σ n
- We will generally assume as known the measurement vector y, the system matrix A, input matrix B, the input vector u, the observability matrix C, and co-variances Σ d and Σ n

## B. Optimal state estimation with SCNs
- Full-state estimates can be provided by a Kalman filter
- The Kalman filter in continuous time is given by a dynamical system of the form
- The Kalman filter gain matrix, K f ∈ R K×Q , is applied to an error between the observations of the dynamical system and the Kalman filter's own internal estimate, ŷ = Cx.
- For fully identified systems K f can be found by solving an algebraic Riccati equation
- Assuming that K f is known, we can directly implement the optimal filtering under the SCN framework (by following Section II-B2) resulting in the following voltage update rule
- The network internally simulates a linear dynamical system of the form ẋ = Ax + Bu, but also corrects its own estimate according to the external input y.

## C. Optimal control with SCNs
- Now that we have optimal state-estimation we can extend the framework to optimal control by deriving the spiking version of a Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller.
- Given a known system of the form in Eq. ( 5), this controller produces the optimal u signal to minimize the squared error between the state x and a target z.
- This gives rise to a linear control law of the form where K c ∈ R P ×K is the LQR gain matrix, which can be found by solving an algebraic Riccati equation, given assumptions on the cost of state deviations and actuation [27].
- In order to control a partially observable and/or noisy dynamical system, we can combine an LQR controller with a Kalman filter (see Fig. 2C.i).
- The Kalman filter should then be aware of the specific form used for the control, and we can swap out u for the LQR control law (Eq. ( 9) in Eq. ( 7)), resulting in a dynamical system of the form We will refer throughout to the combination of a Kalman filter and LQR control as the ideal controller.
- We can now use the same method as in the previous section to implement this in a spiking network.
- To be able to read out the full control signal, we additionally encode the reference z into the network with a new set of fast connections (similar to Eq. ( 2)), which allows us to read out u from the internal estimates x and ẑ of the network.
- For this we define two sets of decoding weights: D x for x, and D z for ẑ.
- Extending the SCN defined in Eq. ( 8) with LQR control and an internal encoding of z, we get the final voltage update rule where we have indicated the parts of the connectivity that are tracking the external system, the effect of the control on the system, the Kalman filter updates, and the representation of the target signal.
- For the internal estimate x, we now have two sets of recurrent "control" and "target" connections, which represent the LQR controller within the Kalman filter SCN (see Fig. 2C.ii).
- The recurrent control connectivity, Ω c = −D x BK c D x , decodes x from the internal state of the SCN using D x , and applies the LQR gain matrix K c .
- The result is transformed using B, and encoded back into the network.
- The recurrent target connectivity, Ω z = D x BK c D z does something similar, but first reads out ẑ using D z .
- The reference signal, z, is encoded into the network using the same method as defined in Eq. ( 8).
- A more detailed derivation for all these connections can be found in the appendix (section VII).

## IV. RESULTS
- We evaluated the performance of the proposed mathematical framework.
- We analyzed the properties of the spiking patterns for internal robustness against perturbations (e.g., noise, neuron death and external force).
- We applied the networks we derived above to two standard dynamical systems: the linear spring-mass-damper system and the nonlinear cartpole system.

## A. Spring-Mass-Damper (SMD) system

## B. Cartpole system
- Our proposed SCN controller (i.e., linearquadratic-Gaussian spiking control) was evaluated on the nonlinear cartpole system.
- The cartpole has four dynamical variables: the position of the cart, x (= x 1 ), the velocity of the cart v (= x 2 = ẋ1 ), the position of the pole, θ (= x 3 ), and the angular velocity of the pole, ω (= x 4 = ẋ3 ).
- Just like the SMD, our instance of the cartpole has an internal disturbance η d , and it outputs a partially observable state consisting of only the position of the cart, x, with sensor noise η n .
- Note that the cartpole system is a nonlinear dynamical system, but both our ideal and spiking controllers assume linear dynamics.
- To produce a meaningful control signal, we use linearized dynamics for the internal estimate. In our case, we linearized around the up-position of the pole (θ = π).
- Fig. 5B compares a cartpole system controlled through an idealized controller (red) to a cartpole controlled through an SCN controller (green). On top of that, we show the reference signal (blue, dashed), which is a stair-wise increase of the cart position, x.
- The task of the controllers is then to move the cart whilst keeping the pole upright. In the figure, we show the position (x) of the cart and the angle of the pole (θ). We see that both controllers follow the reference signal almost perfectly, and most importantly, keep the pole upright.
- The spike plots show that especially with a large amount of neurons, the spiking is irregular and sparse. Increased spiking activity is observed when the reference signal demands a high precision.

## V. CONCLUSION
- For fully identified systems, there exist highly efficient closed-form control solutions
- In this work, we provided an extension of SCN theory to allow optimal estimation and control -providing spiking equivalents for Kalman filters and LQR control
- We showed that these networks maintain sparse and irregular spiking patterns when controlling a dynamical system, and are robust to both severe neural silencing and system perturbations
- Relevantly, our networks are analytically derived and do not need learning nor optimization
- Hence, our presented approach opens up the prospect for deploying fast, efficient and lowpower SNN on-chip controllers with the advantage of having hardware intrinsic redundancy (i.e., the controller still works when some of the neurons stop working) and ensuring that neurons only fire when there is a prediction error

## VII. APPENDIX: DETAILED DERIVATION OF NETWORK

## CONNECTIVITY
- The author uses SCN theory to take the dynamical system corresponding to the continuous Kalman filter and LQR control and implement them in an SNN.
- For both cases they start with the autoencoding network v = −λv + D ( ẋ + λx) + Ω f s.
- This network takes as an external input x and its derivative ẋ and can accurately track this signal with the read-out Dr.
- To implement a given dynamical system in this network they need to do two things. (1) replace the derivative of the input by the desired dynamics ( ẋ = f (x, u)). (2) Instead of feeding the state of x as an external input, estimate the current state from the network read-out x = Dr, and feed that back into the input (by simply replacing x by x).
- This results in network dynamics given by: If f (x, u) is purely linear this can be done through a set of slow connections, as in the main text.

## A. Estimation
- The continuous definition of the Kalman filter is given by Eq. 7.
- The final voltage dynamics to implement a Kalman filter in a recurrent SNN is given by Eq. 8.

## B. Control + estimation
- The Kalman filter can be defined as a continuous equation
- The Kalman filter can be implemented in a recurrent SNN
- The voltage update rule for the Kalman filter is given by Eq. 11

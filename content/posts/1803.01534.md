# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Instance segmentation is a challenging task that aims to predict class labels and pixelwise instance masks
- It is used in autonomous vehicles, robotics, and video surveillance
- Deep convolutional neural networks have been used to create frameworks for instance segmentation
- Mask R-CNN is a simple and effective system for instance segmentation
- Feature pyramid network is used to extract in-network feature hierarchy
- COCO, Cityscapes, and MVD are datasets used to improve algorithms
- Principles such as shortening information path and increasing flexibility of information paths have been proposed
- Research indicates that information propagation in Mask R-CNN can be improved
- PANet is proposed to improve instance segmentation
- PANet achieves state-of-the-art performance on several datasets

## Related work
- Instance segmentation has two main streams: proposal-based and segmentation-based
- Features from different layers are used in image recognition
- FPN assigns proposals to appropriate feature levels for inference
- ION, Zagoruyko et al., Hypernet and Hypercolumn concatenate feature grids from different layers
- Methods of [15,64,62] pool features for each proposal with a foveal structure
- PSPNet and ParseNet use global pooling to improve semantic segmentation
- Mask prediction branch supports accessing global information

## Framework
- Framework is illustrated in Figure 1
- Path augmentation and aggregation is used to improve performance
- Adaptive feature pooling allows each proposal to access information from all levels
- Complementary path is added to mask-prediction branch
- Improvement is independent of CNN structure

### Bottom-up path augmentation
- Motivation for augmenting a top-down path in FPN
- Propagating strong responses of low-level patterns to enhance localization capability
- Augmented bottom-up structure starts from lowest level P2 and gradually approaches P5
- Building blocks take higher resolution feature map N i and a coarser map P i+1
- Feature grid for each proposal is pooled from new feature maps {N 2 , N 3 , N 4 , N 5 }

### Adaptive feature pooling
- FPN assigns proposals to different feature levels based on size
- This can lead to non-optimal results
- Adaptive feature pooling pools features from all levels for each proposal and fuses them for prediction
- Max operation is used to fuse features from different levels
- 70% of features for small proposals are from higher levels
- 50%+ of features for large proposals are from lower levels
- Adaptive feature pooling is simple to implement and is illustrated in Figure 1(c)

### Fully-connected fusion
- Fully-connected layers (MLP) and convolutional layers (FCN) are widely used in mask prediction in instance segmentation and mask proposal generation.
- Results show that FCN is competent in predicting pixelwise masks for instances.
- Fully-connected layers are location sensitive, while FCN gives prediction at each pixel based on a local receptive field and parameters are shared at different spatial locations.
- Mask prediction structure consists of a small FCN and a short path from layer conv3 to a fc layer.

## Experiments
- Compared method with state-of-the-arts on COCO, Cityscapes and MVD datasets
- Results top ranked in all datasets
- Conducted ablation study on COCO dataset
- Presented results on COCO 2017 Instance Segmentation and Object Detection Challenges

### Implementation details
- Re-implemented Mask R-CNN and FPN based on Caffe
- Pre-trained models used in experiments are publicly available
- Image centric training adopted
- 512 ROIs sampled with positive-to-negative ratio of 1:3
- Weight decay set to 0.0001, momentum set to 0.9
- Hyper-parameters vary according to datasets
- Proposals from independently trained RPN

### Experiments on coco
- COCO dataset is used for instance segmentation and object detection
- It consists of 115k images for training and 5k images for validation
- Standard evaluation metrics are used (AP, AP 50 , AP 75 , AP S , AP M and AP L )
- Hyper-parameters are taken from Mask R-CNN and FPN
- Bottom-up path augmentation, adaptive feature pooling and fully-connected fusion are analyzed
- Multi-scale training, multi-GPU synchronized batch normalization and heavier head are also analyzed
- Max and sum operations are used for feature fusing
- PANet reaches 1st place in Instance Segmentation task and 2nd place in Object Detection task
- Deformable convolutions are used
- Detection results are acquired by tightening instance masks

### Experiments on cityscapes
- Used Cityscapes dataset and metrics to compare with state-of-the-art
- Our method outperforms Mask R-CNN with "fine-only" data by 5.6 points
- Pre-training on COCO further improves performance by 4.4 points
- Multi-GPU synchronized batch normalization improves accuracy by 1.5 points
- Full PANet boosts performance by 1.9 points

### Experiments on mvd
- MVD is a dataset for instance segmentation with 25,000 images.
- The images are from different countries and have varying content and resolution.
- Results are reported in terms of AP and AP 50.
- PANet with one ResNet-50 performs comparably with the ensemble result with pre-training on COCO.
- With multi-scale and horizontal flip testing, PANet performs even better.

## Conclusion
- We have presented a PANet for instance segmentation
- We designed components to enhance information propagation
- We pool features from all feature levels
- Complementary path is augmented to enrich feature for each proposal
- Impressive results are produced
- Future work will be to extend method to video and RGBD data

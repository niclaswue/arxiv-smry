# Abstract
- Retrosynthesis is a cornerstone of organic chemistry
- AI has revolutionized retrosynthesis
- This review provides a taxonomy of existing methods and a comparison of their performance
- Popular databases and platforms for retrosynthesis are introduced
- Discussion of promising research directions is included

# Paper Content

## Single-step retrosynthesis methods
- Single-step retrosynthesis can be divided into two categories: selection-based and generation-based
- Selection-based methods use chemical knowledge to make predictions, but have limited generalization ability
- Generation-based methods generate reactants directly and have wider generalization ability

### Selection-based methods
- Two types of selection-based retrosynthesis methods: reactant selection and template selection

### Generation-based methods
- Generation-based retrosynthesis methods rely on no chemical knowledge
- Divided into template-free methods and semi-template methods
- Semi-template methods divide retrosynthesis into two steps: identify reaction center and complete synthons to reactants
- Template-free methods formulate retrosynthesis as a sequence generation problem
- Sequence can be a series of SMILES tokens or molecular edit actions on the molecule graph
- Modeled as a sequence-to-sequence translation problem
- Encoder-Decoder architecture based on LSTM cells
- Transformer-based network to train the forward reaction prediction and retrosynthesis simultaneously
- Data augmentation strategies classified into four categories
- Pretrain tasks divided into two types: same/similar content and modified output
- Transformer performs well on the retrosynthesis task

## Multi-step retrosynthesis methods
- Most molecules require more than one step to synthesize.
- Multi-step retrosynthesis involves building a search tree or directed acyclic graph.
- Search space grows exponentially as route length increases.
- Goal is to find a solution that minimizes user-specified objectives.

### Proof-number search
- Heuristic algorithm uses heuristic function and current state to decide next action
- Heuristic function estimates distance between current node and target
- Modeled as two-player zero-sum game
- AND/OR tree search algorithm
- Search space imbalance in PNS applied to multi-step retrosynthesis prediction
- DFPN-E assigns heuristic cost to edge from OR node to AND node

### Monte carlo tree search
- Neuralsym [21] combined with MCTS [23] to perform multi-step retrosynthesis prediction
- MCTS uses selection, expansion, rollout, and update steps
- Two neural networks used to guide search and verify reaction rules
- Third neural network used to quickly find a solution
- Rewards and position values updated depending on difficulty of molecule synthesis
- Lin et al. [42] combined MCTS with Transformer
- Ishida et al. [75] proposed improvements to MCTS architecture
- GCN-based policy network and retrosynthesis scores introduced to guide search in desired direction

### A* search
- Chen et al. proposed the Retro* algorithm which combines A* search with the AND/OR tree.
- A* search considers the informed cost of the current position from the starting position.
- Xie et al. proposed RetroGraph which is combined with a GNN-guided policy to eliminate intra-target duplication.

### Others
- Existing methods optimize single-or multi-step solvers individually
- Kim et al. proposed a universal end-to-end framework to improve single-step solver
- Framework includes two additional models: reference backward model and forward reaction model
- Experiments on Retro* showed significant improvement in success rate of reaction pathway
- Schwaller et al. proposed metric, round-trip accuracy, to evaluate single-step methods
- Deep reinforcement learning is a non-heuristic algorithm worth exploring

## Evaluation methodology
- Aim to provide quantitative analyses of retrosynthesis algorithms
- Focus on single-step and multi-step algorithms

### Single-step retrosynthesis
- Necessary to develop benchmarking metrics to compare models
- Experiments to compare different retrosynthesis methods
- Principles followed to maximize fairness of comparison
- Databases used for building blocks
- USPTO dataset used for evaluation
- RetroGraph uses directed graphs to speed up algorithm
- Retro* and RetroGraph achieved most comprehensive results
- MCTS is slowest and worst in terms of success rate

### Multi-step retrosynthesis
- Definition of "good synthesis route" is ambiguous
- Segler et al. conducted a double-blind AB test to evaluate routes
- Test is too time-consuming and expensive for large-scale datasets
- Table 2 shows most multi-step search methods use Neuralsym
- Genheden et al. proposed PaRoutes framework for benchmarking
- DFPN is inferior to MCTS and Retro* in terms of route quality and diversity
- PaRoutes provides open and fair evaluation platform for researchers

## Database and platform for retrosynthesis
- Many data databases have emerged in recent years
- Big data technology has provided convenience for researchers to develop CASP tool
- Several research groups have developed their own CASP platforms
- Some databases and platforms are opensource and publicly available, others require commercial access

### Reaction database
- USPTO is the predominant open-source reaction database in machine learning, containing 1.9 million reactions
- Data quality is uneven due to incorrect or duplicate reactions
- Atom mapping in reactions is automatically generated and not guaranteed to be correct
- ChEMU is a manually annotated database of organic reaction texts in 1500 patents
- Reaxys and CAS are subscription databases with detailed information of over 145 million single-step and multi-step reactions since 1840
- Pistachio is a text-mining approach with over 9 million reactions from US and European Patent Office

### Retrosynthesis planning platform
- Coley et al. developed open-source software for CASP called ASKCOS
- ASKCOS consists of 3 steps: propose a pathway, verify route quality, robotic arm completes synthesis
- ASKCOS reduces workload of chemists
- Genheden et al. developed open-source CASP software AiZynthFinder
- IBM RoboRXN is a reaction prediction tool
- Synthia, Reaxys, CAS SciFinder, ChemAIRS are commercial platforms
- CASP methods comparable to experienced chemists

## Challenges and opportunities

### More reasonable metric
- Current single-step retrosynthesis tasks lack reasonable and universal metrics
- Model should focus on low cost, high-yielding, and diversity
- Possible to train a new neural network model to determine if reaction meets requirements
- Current value function built with aim of finding shortest path, loses sight of necessary factors

### More data
- Amount of data in current public datasets is insufficient
- Current datasets contain only successful reactions, not failed ones
- Reaction conditions such as temperature and catalyst are ignored

### Interpretability
- AI-based retrosynthesis has lack of interpretability
- Machine learning models may capture literature popularity trends
- Outstanding organic synthesis should inspire chemists to design better drug molecules
- Current retrosynthesis work interprets the retrosynthesis to some extent
- Transformer-based methods use cross-attention mechanism to explain why most substructures in product are kept in reactants
- Interpretable retrosynthesis should be able to attribute predictions to specific atoms or substructures
- Work has been conducted to attribute properties to molecular fragments for property prediction tasks
- If similar attribution could be achieved in retrosynthesis, it would help researchers design drug molecules

## Conclusion
- AI-based retrosynthesis has become an inspiring research area
- AI outperforms traditional expert systems in terms of cost and efficiency
- AI-based retrosynthesis has great promise
- AI-based retrosynthesis is not yet mature
- Goal is to discover synthetic routes for new drugs with lower cost and higher yield
- AI has not yet provided a brand-new synthetic route that was successfully synthesized
- Cooperation between chemists and computer experts is necessary
- AI-based retrosynthesis has been compared in USPTO and USPTO-EXT datasets

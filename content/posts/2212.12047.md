## Results and discussion

## Elastic properties of rn unit cells
- Considered RN unit cells composed of 16 nodes
- Allowed for a broader range of elastic properties
- Higher chance of extreme negative and extreme positive Poisson's ratios
- Possible to generate unit cells with average nodal connectivity values of 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, and 4.5
- Number of beam-like elements in the RN unit cells varied between 20 and 42
- Estimated number of unit cells that can be generated ≈ 9.22 × 10 11
- Average simulation time per design ≈ 5.42 × 10 −4 s
- Takes ≈ 5761 days to perform FE analysis on all these RN unit cells
- Performed FE analysis on 6 million randomly generated RN unit cells
- Elastic properties cover a cone-like region with a range of (0 , 0.25) and (−1.5 , 1.2)
- Trained a DL model to predict the four elastic properties of any RN unit cell

- Evaluation of the trained model had an overall coefficient of determination ( 2 ) of 0.997
- Evaluation of the DL model takes ≈ 2.44 × 10 −5 s per design

## Generative inverse design framework

- Latent space size chosen to be 8
- Selected two hidden layers with 512 and 260 neurons
- ReLU and Sigmoid activation functions for output layer

- Heat maps of MSE values used to quantify expected error values for different elastic properties and dimensions
- Gray regions represent designs with MSE values exceeding acceptance threshold
- Envelopes of successful design generations converge for large enough values of  1 and  2

## Stress distribution
- Deep-DRAM provides solutions to the design problem of finding RN lattice structures with pre-defined dimensions and elastic properties.
- It is possible to apply additional design requirements, such as criteria regarding the stress distributions observed within the generated structures.
- Three groups of combinatorial designs with predefined specifications were studied and the first 1000 designs with MSE < 0.1 were further analyzed using FE simulations.

## Discussions and future outlook
- Deep-DRAM framework is a combination of four modules
- Modular approach allows modules to be combined with other tools
- Modularity and probabilistic nature of CVAE allows multi-objective design optimization
- Generating and evaluating individual designs is in the range of micro-seconds
- Modular design and ad hoc combination with direct FE modeling affords flexibility

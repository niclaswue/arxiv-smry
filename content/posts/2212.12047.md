- Peak stresses should be minimized as well
- The Deep-DRAM approach integrates four decoupled models to solve the multi-objective inverse design problem

# Paper Content

## INTRODUCTION
- The second and third decades of the 21st century have witnessed the emergence of architected materials with bespoke, unusual properties that stem from their small-scale design.
- At the nexus of rational design techniques, where computational models are used to establish designproperty relationships, and additive manufacturing (AM, = 3D printing) techniques, which enable the realization of arbitrarily complex designs, a highly vibrant sub-discipline has emerged that is rapidly pushing such designer materials into applications in medical devices, soft robotics, and other advanced areas of research.
- Depending on the type of the properties targeted, these architected materials may be referred to as mechanical metamaterials, acoustic metamaterials, or meta-biomaterials.
- Despite their recent academic success, there are two major challenges that hinder the real-world applications of metamaterials in general and mechanical metamaterials in particular.
- To put these challenges in perspective, let us consider a typical device design scenario where the required elastic properties as well as the dimensions of a device are specified by the device designer.
- The design problem is then reduced to the problem of finding the microarchitectures that give rise to the required elastic properties while also satisfying the size requirements.
- The difficulty of such an inverse design problem is further exacerbated by the fact that most mechanical metamaterials are usually only analyzed in terms of their homogenized or asymptotic properties (i.e., when the number of the constituting unit cells approaches infinity). Such homogenized solutions are only valid at their convergence limits and may significantly deviate from the actual elastic properties when the number of unit cells is not large enough.
- Given the limited resolution of AM techniques, it is often impossible to fit a very large number of unit cells within a given set of dimensions. Homogenized solutions may, therefore, not offer too much help when dealing with real-world design problems.
- The inverse design problem should, therefore, not be solved for the asymptotic case of an infinite number of unit cells but for the actual case of a finite number of unit cells in each spatial direction.
- Here, we use deep learning (DL) models and deep generative models to tackle such a size-agnostic inverse design problem within the context of random-network (RN) mechanical metamaterials.
- Most of the mechanical metamaterials developed to date are composed of periodic unit cells. Previous studies have, however, shown that RN units cells, consisting of stretch-and bendingdominated beam-like structures, allow for a wide range of conventional and auxetic elastic properties, which may go beyond the limits achieved by geometrically-ordered mechanical metamaterials, particularly when seeking after rare combinations of elastic properties.
- We will, therefore, use RN designs to increase the chance of finding accurate solutions for the inverse design problems targeted here.
- A facet of such nonlinear inverse problems relevant to microarchitecture design of mechanical metamaterials concerns the non-uniqueness of the solution.
- It is important to realize that different solutions to the inverse problem posed in the previous paragraph are not equal in many other aspects. That is because designs with similar effective properties could have highly different stress distributions and, thus, highly different degrees of resistance to fatigue and fracture.
- We are, therefore, interested to find as many of solutions to the posed inverse problem as possible so that additional design requirements, such a uniform stress distribution or a minimum stress peak, can be applied.
- This further increases the practical utility of the approach presented here.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

## Elastic properties of RN unit cells
- For the first module, we considered RN unit cells composed of 16 nodes (×,= = 4) because this number of nodes allows for a broader range of elastic properties when compared to larger sizes of RN unit cells (Supplementary Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 1), as well as a higher chance of extreme negative and extreme positive Poisson's ratios (Supplementary Table 2).
- For this number of nodes, it is possible to generate unit cells with average nodal connectivity values of = 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, and 4.5.
- Depending on the value, the number of beam-like elements in the RN unit cells varied between 20 and 42 (Figure 1a).
- It should be noted that the total estimated number of unit cells that can be generated, whether they abide by the design limitations or not, considering the above-mentioned values of is ≈ 9.22 × 10 11 (Supplementary Table 3).
- Assuming that the average simulation time per design equals ≈ 5.42 × 10 −4 s (Supplementary Figure 3), it takes approximately 497 million seconds (= 5761 days) (Supplementary Table 3) to perform FE analysis on all these RN unit cells.
- The huge number of possible designs highlights the need to have an ultra-fast model to predict the elastic properties of the RN unit cells.
- We performed FE analysis on 6 million randomly generated RN unit cells (i.e., 1.2 million unit cells from each group of ) as the training group.
- The elastic properties in directions 1 and 2, which were calculated by FE modeling of these unit cells, cover a cone-like region with a range of (0 , 0.25) and (−1.5 , 1.2) for the relative elastic moduli ( 11 /and  22 /, where  is the elastic modulus of the bulk material) and Poisson's ratios ( 12 and  21 ), respectively (Figure 1b).
- The distributions of the relative elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio in directions 1 and 2 had similar ranges of values. Moreover, the results show that the RN unit cells are highly anisotropic.
- The broad range of the elastic properties is due to the possibility to generate both stretching-and bending-dominated structures using random distributions of elements as well as by changing . These results confirm that it is possible to devise RN unit cells with extreme positive and extreme negative values of the Poisson's ratio as well as rare-event 19 doubleauxetic unit cells.
- We selected six unit cells from the different groups of elastic properties, i.e., almost extreme positive and negative values of the Poisson's ratio in one direction, almost extreme doubleauxeticity, almost extreme elastic moduli in both directions, and moderate positive and negative values of the Poisson's ratio as well as moderate values of the elastic moduli in both directions (Figure 1b).
- To validate the results of our simulations, we 3D printed and experimentally evaluated the elastic properties and deformation patterns of these six unit cells.
- The experimentally obtained values of the elastic moduli (see the stress-strain curves in Supplementary Figure 4) and Poisson's ratios show a good agreement with FE simulations (Supplementary Table 4).
- Moreover, the deformation patterns follow similar trends in both simulations and experiments (Figure 1c).
- In some elements within the FE models, we see higher levels of deformations predicted by FE models as compared to those observed experimentally. These small differences may be explained by the assumptions of the FE models, including a linear elastic...

## Generative inverse design framework
- For the inverse design of RN unit cells, we trained a deep generative model based on CVAE that was paired with the pretrained forward predictor (i.e., the unit cell elastic properties model)
- The size of the latent space was chosen to be 8
- For both recognition and reconstruction models of the CVAE, we selected two hidden layers with 512 and 260 neurons, an Adam optimizer, and ReLU activation functions throughout both hidden layers
- The reconstruction model of the trained CVAE was separated and called "unit cell generative model"
- To assess the generative ability of this model, the elastic properties of the test dataset and a random sampling from a normal distribution (~(0,1)) were passed as inputs to this model
- The results of this comparison showed an overall coefficient of determination (2) of 0.865, an MAE of 5.1 × 10−2, and an MSE of 8.5 × 10−3

## Unit cells with requested rare elastic properties
- The deep generative model is able to generate unit cells with new elastic properties that were not seen before in the training or test datasets.
- The deep generative model is of value for the efficient generation of unit cells with predefined elastic properties, specially rare-event properties, such as doubleauxeticity.

## Elastic properties of combinatorial designs
- We studied combinatorial designs composed of 1 × 2 repetitions of RN unit cells
- Assuming 1 and 2 are values varying in a range of (2, 20), we studied a total of 100 combinatorial designs from each RN unit cell
- We used the undersampled dataset of RN unit cells (dataset size = 81,569), which was used for the training of the unit cell elastic properties model, and performed numerical simulations for all the 100 combinatorial designs composed of these RN unit cells (size of dataset = 8,156,900)
- The generated dataset was further used to train a forward predictor called "size-agnostic model" that predicts the elastic properties of the combinatorial designs
- To train the model, we assumed MinMaxScaler as the scaling method, ReLU as the activation function of all the hidden layers as well as of the output layer, and Adam as the optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001, which were adopted from the hyperparameter tuning step of the unit cell elastic properties model
- The hyperparameter tuning step of the deep generative model resulted in 6 hidden layers with 512, 428, 343, 258, 174, and 89 neurons, respectively
- Within 200 epochs, the prediction errors (MSE, MAE) reduced from MSE = 4.7 × 10 −3 and MAE = 2.9 × 10 −2 to MSE = 1.6 × 10 −5 and MAE = 2.9 × 10 −3 for the training dataset and from MSE = 4.1 × 10 −3 and MAE = 1.4 × 10 −2 to MSE = 1.7 × 10 −5 and MAE = 3.0 × 10 −3 for the validation dataset
- The trained model had an overall 2 of 0.995 for the test dataset (10% of the original dataset), confirming that it can accurately predict the elastic properties of the combinatorial designs

## Inverse design of lattice structures with requested elastic properties and dimensions
- We combined the unit cell generative model and the size-agnostic model to develop a comprehensive and powerful framework called Deep-DRAM.
- Given the requested elastic properties, we first used the deep generative model to generate 10 5 RN unit cells.
- It takes the deep generative model 5.7 ± 0.1 s on a workstation (see the Methods section for the specifications) to generate these unit cells.
- Since the returned unit cell structures would vary in their design and mechanical response, they can deviate from the requested set of elastic properties. This is, in fact, an advantage of such a generative model because the actual elastic properties of a lattice structure with a finite (anisotropic) number of unit cells along each spatial direction may be quite different from the unit cell properties.
- The presence of such natural variations in the elastic properties of the generated unit cells enables us to feed a large number of designs created by the deep generative model to the size-agnostic model that is trained to account for the effects of size along each direction.
- Then, all these generated unit cells together with the desired dimensions are introduced to the size-agnostic model to predict the elastic properties of these combinatorial designs.
- Finally, the MSE values showing the difference between the target properties and the final elastic properties of the generated combinatorial designs are calculated.
- Based on the error values, we selected the designs that best matched the target elastic properties for the given dimensions.

## Stress distribution
- Deep-DRAM provides many solutions to the design problem of finding RN lattice structures with pre-defined dimensions and elastic properties.
- It is, therefore, possible to apply additional design requirements, such as criteria regarding the stress distributions observed within the generated structures under various types of loading conditions.
- One such criterion is to choose the design with the minimum peak stress, thereby enhancing their resistance against fatigue and failure.
- To demonstrate the utility of our size-agnostic inverse design framework within this context, we first generated combinatorial designs with predefined elastic properties and dimensions.
- We then filtered the generated designs based on their maximum von Mises stress.
- As representative cases, we studied three groups of combinatorial designs with predefined specifications: i)  1 =  2 = 4,  12 = −0.2, and  21 = 0.2, ii)  1 = 10,  2 = 4,  12 =  21 = 0.5, and iii)  1 =  2 = 10,  12 =  21 = −0.2, while the elastic modulus was assumed to be the same for these three groups (i.e.,  11 /  =  22 /  = 0.03).
- From each group, the first 1000 designs with MSE < 0.1 were further analyzed using FE simulations to determine the stress distribution within their elements under two loading conditions (i.e.,  11 = 5% or  22 = 5%).
- The normalized peak values of the von Mises stress in directions 1 and 2 were then calculated.
- From each group, we selected two specimens with almost the same MSE but with either the minimum or maximum Euclidean distance from the origin.
- The stress distributions corresponding to these case studies clearly show stress concentrations in some regions within the specimens with the maximum Euclidean distances (i.e., specimens 2, 4, and 6) while the stress distribution are comparatively more uniform within specimens 1, 3, and 5 (Figure 5c).
- The specimens with high peak stresses are prone to premature crack initiation and growth and should be avoided in the design of mechanical metamaterials aimed for practical applications.

## DISCUSSIONS AND FUTURE OUTLOOK
- The Deep-DRAM framework presented here is a combination of four modules and provides many opportunities for the design of mechanical metamaterials.
- In addition, the presented modular approach allows the individual modules to be combined with other tools available elsewhere to provide solutions for the many challenges encountered in the design of designer materials.
- To a degree, the modularity of this approach and the probabilistic nature of the CVAE allows us to decouple some of the problems encountered in the design and optimization of mechanical metamaterials, thereby enabling multi-objective design optimization with minimum development and computational costs.
- For example, the multiple objectives of achieving a certain set of elastic properties and minimizing the peak stress within the structure can be handled in-series with minimum computational costs.
- That is partially due to the extremely high speeds of both generating and evaluating individual designs, which are in the range of micro-seconds.
- There are a number of points that need to be discussed regarding the broader use of Deep-DRAM. First, while we focused on a specific choice of RN for this study, the same methodology can also be used for any underlying design paradigm including any other types (i.e., size, organization) of random structures as well as ordered structures and a combination thereof.
- Second, the modular design of our approach as well as its ad hoc combination with direct FE modeling affords it a high degree of flexibility in terms of taking design requirements into account and tackling multiple types of problems that are challenging in their own right.
- For example, the problem of finding rare combinations of elastic properties is treated independently in multiple other studies but can also be studied, within the confines of the selected RN design, using the modules developed here.
- Third, our focus on the linear elastic properties meant that we used linear elastic constitutive models everywhere in the current study. However, the same approach can be used to study the nonlinear properties of RN designs or to consider any other aspects of their constitutive behavior (e.g., viscoelasticity).
- The only difference would be that the FE models need to be modified to reflect the more complex constitutive behavior.
- Indeed, the relative advantage of the presented approach would be even more evident when the simulation time is longer, such as the case of nonlinear or viscoelastic constitutive behaviors.
- Fourth, the compact and computationally efficient nature of the final models means that they can be implemented in low-resource settings to power edge computing applications.
- Finally, some elements of the developed modulus (i.e., even individual layers) can be used for more advanced machine learning approaches, such as transfer learning, to further generalize the domain of application of our models.

## CONCLUSIONS
- Developed a size-agnostic inverse design framework, Deep-DRAM, which can generate RN lattice structures not only with predefined elastic properties but also with predefined dimensions suitable for any intended application.
- Showed that combining deep generative models with forward predictors is successful in generating bespoke mechanical metamaterials while also satisfying additional design requirements, such as minimum peak stresses, to improve the endurance of designer materials for real-world applications.
- All the FE models were created using MATLAB (MATLAB R2018b, MathWorks, USA) codes.
- Custom codes were used to design the structures by randomly connecting each node to its surrounding nodes and to perform the FE simulations that estimate the elastic properties of the resulting structures (i.e., the elastic moduli and Poisson's ratios in both orthogonal in-plane directions).
- The random distribution of beams resulted in 'loose designs' where some nodes were not connected to the overall grid. To exclude such designs, we used a graph-based search method (breadth-first search) for filtering and discarding such invalid unit cell designs.
- The applied graph-based algorithm sped up the process by nearly 900 times as compared to an image-based filtering method used previously.

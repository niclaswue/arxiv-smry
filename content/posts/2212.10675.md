# Abstract
- Computational models can be applied to the biological world.
- View should be observer-dependent and pragmatic.
- Living systems can perform multiple functions in the same place at the same time (polycomputing).
- Understanding of meso-scale events can be improved with an observer-centered framework.
- Overloading of different functions on the same hardware is an important design principle.

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Feynman argued that manipulating matter and energy at small scales could lead to vast technological progress
- Biology expands the adaptive function of an existing system by overloading mechanisms with multiple functions, which is called polycomputing
- Examples of polycomputing in biology include spider webs that serve as auditory sensors and prey capture devices, and holographic memory storage in the brain
- Examples of polycomputing in computer and materials engineering are emerging
- Polycomputing is defined as the ability of a material to provide the results of more than one computation in the same place at the same time
- The notion of "computer" needs to be expanded to include massively parallel, stochastic, emergent, and evolutionary systems
- The question of what constitutes a "living thing" is being redefined due to new chimeric, synthetic, and bioengineering techniques
- Polycomputing helps us understand, predict, and control new classes of evolved and designed materials

## Current debates: dissolving dichotomous thinking
- Researchers look to nature for inspiration when technological progress slows
- Examples include photosynthesis and flapping wings
- Difficulty of packing more compute into microchips challenges researchers to seek new paths by considering how computation is embedded in living systems
- Debate about whether organisms are machines has a long history and has become more intense in recent years
- Machines capable of computation include robots and physical computers, but exclude simple mechanical devices

## Structure function mapping and polycomputing.
- 1-to-1 mapping between structure and function is difficult to tease apart
- Advances in biology and computer science are demolishing long held dichotomies
- Machines can support different functions at different spatial scales and times
- Investigating polycomputing enables new questions for biology and a quest for engineers to understand how to pack more functionality into the same machine

## Assumed distinction counterexamples

## Software/hardware
- Physical materials can compute and learn
- Tape-less von Neumann self replicators
- Digital/analog circuits can exploit electromagnetic properties of the circuit's substrate
- AI-designed organisms
- Intentional stance for automaton/free agent
- Brain/body computational metamaterials

## Body/environment
- Cells in multicellular bodies have an environment
- AI technologies can pass verbal, visual, and physical Turing tests
- Artefacts can be created or evolved by human-created evolutionary algorithms

## Dichotomous thinking in the life sciences.
- Biology does not support dichotomous categories.
- Evolution and developmental biology exhibit gradualism.
- There is no clear line between cognitive humans and quiescent oocytes.
- Categories represent poles of a spectrum of diverse properties.
- Interoperability of life enables chimeras of all levels of organization.
- Cognitive and logistical limitations lead to departmental, funding, and publication distinctions.
- Cognitive neuroscience techniques can be used to understand collective intelligence of cells.

## Dichotomous thinking in computer science.
- Advances in computational sciences challenge the boundary between body and brain.
- Physical computing and morphological computing are technologies that are eating away at this distinction.
- Mechanical computing uses optical, mechanical, or quantum phenomena to perform calculations.

## Polycomputing in bodies and brains.
- Polycomputing can be shuttled between biological bodies and brains and machine bodies and brains.
- Polycomputation requires storage of multiple computations at the same place and time, but at different peaks in the frequency spectrum.
- Digital circuitry and biological nervous systems cannot perform polycomputation as they traffic in electrons and chemicals/ions, not vibration.
- Neurons may communicate mechanically, which may contain vibrational components, suggesting nervous systems may be able to polycompute.
- Computer science shows how taking a causal stance at higher levels enables progress.
- Boolean networks can compute different functions simultaneously depending on the level of analysis chosen by an observer.
- Computational metaphors applied to brains have assumed tissues, cells, and other biological systems that are not brains do not compute.
- Studies of basal cognition in plants, single somatic cells, microbes, and tissues suggest the brain/body dichotomy is being dismantled.

## Learning from superposed systems in engineering
- Computational density can be increased by computing and storing multiple results in the same place at the same time.
- Quantum computing can perform multiple computations simultaneously.
- Non-quantum forms of computational superposition suggest more computation can be packed into smaller spaces.
- Holographic data storage stores data dispersed across the storage medium.
- Physical reservoir computing can extract desired computations from inert materials.

## Biology is massively overloaded: polycomputing
- Analyzing natural systems to determine polycomputation is challenging
- Traditional engineering design principles are not effective
- Changes to optimize one function can interfere with another
- AI methods can design polycomputable technologies
- Evolutionary algorithm used to design granular metamaterial
- Many biological functions can be analyzed as computations
- Evolutionary algorithm can be used to evolve metamaterials
- Metamaterials can act as AND and XOR gates simultaneously

## Table 2: examples of biological polycomputing at diverse scales multiple computations in the same biological hardware reference
- Mitochondria act as micro-lenses in photoreceptors
- Proteins act in multiple conformations
- Gene regulatory networks have multiple memories/behaviors
- Chemical networks perform neural network tasks
- RNA encodes enzyme and protein functions
- DNA has more than one active reading frame
- Ion channels are also transcription factors
- DNA transcription factors work in DNA replication machinery

## Polycomputing and the range of phenotypic possibility.
- Xenobots are proto-organisms made from frog skin cells
- They can self-assemble and move autonomously
- They can even self-replicate
- Evolution teaches us how to make systems with cells that can be coerced into different shapes and behaviors
- Evolution creates generic problem-solving machines
- Evolution exploits the competencies of cells to create adaptive outcomes

## Evolving polycomputing.
- Evolution is slower without a multiscale competency architecture
- Cells can make an eye in aberrant locations and still provide vision
- Competency of substrate in regulative development and remodeling can neutralize lethal side effects of mutations
- Monocomputational developmental architecture would prevent exploration of beneficial effects of mutations
- Polycomputing architecture allows exploration of consequences of mutations
- Cells and tissues allow exploration of other effects of mutations on phenotype
- Machines harness laws of physics, computation, etc. to produce specific, useful outcomes
- Evolution exploits fact that life is a machine by making changes to material, control algorithm, and environment
- Polycomputing architecture produces plasticity, robustness, and novelty

## A new approach to identifying and harnessing computational capabilities in vivo and in silico.
- GRNs are a formalism used to study gene regulation
- Evolution enriches for learning capacity in biological networks
- Biological networks can offer multiple different types of memory and computations
- Evolution searches for ways to exploit existing components as features of the environment
- Brain stores multiple memories in the same neuronal real-estate

## Conceptual transitions
- Overcome human cognitive bias
- Resist temptation to cleave phenomena apart
- Look for non-intuitive phenomena
- Seek gradients to move from "obvious" approximations to more accurate reflections of reality

## Directions of conceptual travel.
- Tasks can be performed in parallel or serially
- Human thinking is mostly serial
- Traditional parallelism assumes multiple processes are coincident in time but not in space
- Superposition is the performance of multiple functions in the same place at the same time
- Modular processes are usually preferred in engineering, but natural phenomena are often continua

## Practical implications for ai/robotics.
- Learning how biological systems polycompute can create more efficient AI technologies and robots
- Polycomputing technology may be more compatible with biological components, creating biohybrids
- Polycomputing may lead to machines that perform multiple functions in the same place at the same time
- Polycomputing may provide a solution to catastrophic interference
- Gradual computing in biology is important to track the emergence of specific features
- Boot-up of a biologically-embodied intelligence involves polycomputing
- Transition from analog device to computer is a shift in the relative payoffs for two different formalisms
- Recognizing the degree of agency in potential interaction partners is important
- Polycomputing systems may be capable of acceding to multiple requests simultaneously

## Becoming a computer
- Computers are not just physical machines, but a theoretical construct known as a Turing Machine
- Turing Machines can be embodied by organisms, fluids, algorithms, and other physical systems
- It can be difficult to tell when a system transitions from "just physical materials" to a computer
- Biological Turing Machines may not have a localized tape
- Systems can change over time, making it difficult to determine when it becomes a computer
- Polycomputing systems can provide different results to different observers, making it difficult to determine if it is a computer

# Abstract
- Revisit the rotation averaging problem applied in global Structure-from-Motion pipelines.
- Current methods have a weakly connected cost function with the input data.
- Proposed method directly propagates uncertainty from point correspondences into the rotation averaging.
- Integrate a variant of the MAGSAC loss into the rotation averaging problem.
- Results superior to baselines in terms of accuracy on large-scale public benchmarks.

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Building 3D reconstructions from unordered image collections is important for crowd-sourced mapping.
- Structure-from-Motion is used to estimate camera parameters and scene geometry.
- There are two types of Structure-from-Motion: incremental and global.
- Incremental methods are more accurate but have high computational cost.
- Global methods are less accurate but have lower computational cost.
- Rotation averaging is used to estimate globally consistent rotations.
- Current methods use a cost function that is weakly connected to the input data.
- This paper proposes to better model the underlying noise distributions.
- This paper also proposes to integrate a variant of the MAGSAC loss.

## Rotation averaging with uncertainties
- Proposed a way to leverage uncertainties in rotation averaging
- Rotation averaging is a component of global SfM algorithms
- Formalized as a graph optimization problem
- Vertices are image poses, edges are relative poses
- Primary goal is to use constraints to find absolute poses of cameras
- Uncertainty-aware rotation averaging considers quality of relative poses
- Uncertainty is propagated from features to relative rotation
- Covariances are plugged into optimization procedure to consider pair-wise uncertainties

### Marginalizing over the noise scale
- MAGSAC++ is a robust loss function designed to reduce dependence on manually set inlier-outlier threshold parameter
- MAGSAC++ loss assumes inlier residuals follow a χ2-distribution and does not make assumptions about outliers
- Data points are a set of relative rotations, and the models to estimate are the global orientations of the cameras
- Inlier weight is calculated using a formula with noise standard deviation, residual, and prior distribution of σ
- Residuals are assumed to be normally distributed with the same variance
- Weight of each edge is calculated by passing its residual to a formula
- Loss is minimized by IRLS and each iteration guarantees a non-increase in the loss

## Experiments
- Tested global SfM implemented in Theia library with and without considering uncertainties
- Evaluated popular loss functions, including Soft L 1
- Used angle-axis rotation parameterization to minimize relative rotation error
- Tested on 1DSfM and ETH3D datasets
- Tuned hyper-parameters on Madrid Metropolis scene
- Compared weighting schemes using inlier number and proposed covariance
- Used Cauchy loss and did not use MAGSAC to avoid bias
- MAGSAC with covariance method outperformed all other methods
- Proposed algorithm led to more than 10 points increase in AUC score
- Proposed pipeline more accurate than baseline when images are downsampled
- Lowest median orientation error achieved by proposed algorithm
- Global approaches run-time two orders of magnitude lower than COLMAP

## Conclusion
- Problem of rotation averaging applied in global Structure-from-Motion pipelines
- Leveraging uncertainties in two-view epipolar geometries and investigating robust losses
- Integrating covariance matrices of uncertainties directly in optimization procedure improves reconstruction quality
- Carefully choosing robust loss also gives a boost in accuracy
- Source code will be made publicly available

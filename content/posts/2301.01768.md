# Abstract
- Conversational artificial intelligence (AI) disrupts how humans interact with technology
- Recently, OpenAI introduced ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art dialogue model that can converse with its human counterparts with unprecedented capabilities
- ChatGPT has witnessed tremendous attention from the media, academia, industry, and the general public, attracting more than a million users within days of its release
- However, its explosive adoption for information search and as an automated decision aid underscores the importance to understand its limitations and biases
- This paper focuses on one of democratic society's most important decision-making processes: political elections
- Prompting ChatGPT with 630 political statements from two leading voting advice applications and the nation-agnostic political compass test in three pre-registered experiments, we uncover ChatGPT's pro-environmental, left-libertarian ideology
- For example, ChatGPT would impose taxes on flights, restrict rent increases, and legalize abortion
- In the 2021 elections, it would have voted most likely for the Greens both in Germany (B\"undnis 90/Die Gr\"unen) and in the Netherlands (GroenLinks)

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- AI-enabled systems can have a consequential impact on human lives
- Among democratic societies' most important decisionmaking processes are political elections
- What if Chat-GPT exhibits a political ideology that may pervade its synthetic responses and subtly influence its millions of unsuspecting users?
- To probe ChatGPT's political position, we prompt ChatGPT to take a stance on 630 political statements from two leading voting advice applications and a global political compass test
- In three pre-registered experiments, we find converging evidence for ChatGPT's pro-environmental, left-libertarian orientation

## Results
- ChatGPT is a computer program that responds to political statements with three choices: agree, disagree, or neutral
- ChatGPT's alignment with the political parties is highest with the Greens
- ChatGPT is susceptible to subtle prompt manipulations and its alignment with the political parties is not contingent on the linguistic particularities of the prompts used in our main analysis

## Discussion
- Powerful conversational AI systems such as ChatGPT have the potential to revolutionize how humans access information
- However, the adoption of technological innovation critically hinges on users' trust in the technology's accuracy and truthfulness
- Political voting is one of the fundamental and most consequential decision-making processes of democracies
- What if these novel AI-enabled dialogue systems spread a political ideology in their natural interactions with their millions of unsuspecting users?
- To address this question, we probed the political position of ChatGPT in three pre-registered experiments using 630 political statements from two leading voting advice applications and the nation-agnostic political compass test
- Overall, we find converging evidence that ChatGPT exhibits a pro-environmental, left-libertarian political orientation
- Our findings are robust across diverse prompt manipulations, i.e., negations, prompt order, degree of formality, and languages (English, Spanish, Dutch, and German)
- This research bridges and contributes to several streams of literature with time-sensitive, interdisciplinary implications relevant to academic scholars, policymakers, managers, and the public

## Limitations and Future Research Directions.
- The study focused on two voting advice applications, i.e., Germany's Wahl-O-Mat and the Netherlands' StemWijzer, that have collectively attracted more than 120 million users.
- Despite their high reliability, future research can explore the generalizability of our findings across further nations, languages, and voting advice applications.
- Next, future research could explore the origins of Chat-GPT's political ideology. Different sources of its ideological bias are plausible. First, it could originate from the massive web-scraped data that ChatGPT was trained on, which is contaminated with human biases. Second, it could stem from Chat-GPT's human-in-the-loop training procedure, a two-step process in which human AI trainers manually generate prompt solutions and afterwards ranked them by quality. Third, it could result from OpenAI's content moderation filters, which are intended to prevent Chat-GPT from creating and disseminating harmful content.
- Understanding the contribution of these different sources of bias will increase the possibility to tackle them appropriately. At the same time, it is important to note that debiasing attempts can also backfire.

## Conclusions.
- Conversational AI has the potential to revolutionize how humans interact with technology
- The unprecedented speed of adoption of ChatGPT evidences its appeal and accessibility to large parts of society
- The explosive proliferation is a harbinger of the future possibilities of this disruptive technology, both as decision-making aids and as a novel and natural channel for information collection
- However, the character and magnitude of the societal impact of conversational AI is yet to be fully understood, and user trust and adoption critically hinge on the quality of the models' outputs, including unbiased, truthful results
- Across three pre-registered studies, we revealed that in contrast to traditional voting advice application which present factual data (e.g., the Greens support the taxation of flights), conversational AI systems add their own "opinion"
- Overall, we find converging evidence for ChatGPT's consistent pro-environmental, left-leaning position

## Appendix
- ChatGPT is a large language model optimized for dialogue
- The model is "a sibling" of the InstructGPT model
- The training procedure comprises three steps: first, OpenAI fine-tuned GPT-3.5 using a supervised policy; next, a reward model was trained using reinforcement learning; and finally, PPO was used to finetune the final model

## Robustness checks.
- The data was reduced to two dimensions with PCA
- The first dimension represents the political parties and the second dimension represents the ideologies of the different statements
- The data was plotted to show the relationships between the different parties and ideologies

## Web Appendix
- Converging evidence on ChatGPT's pro-environmental, left-libertarian orientation
- The screenshot shows a dialogue with ChatGPT. We ask ChatGPT to write a short poem about the climate. Note that we did not prompt ChatGPT to take any particular stance on this topic. Hence, ChatGPT could have "decided" to compose a poem about anything regarding our planets' climate. Yet, ChatGPT raises the disastrous consequences of climate change ("Heat waves, wildfires, and hurricanes too") and the urgent need to act.

## Id Statement
- A general speed limit should apply on all highways.
- Germany should increase its defense spending.
- Young people aged 16 and over should also be allowed to vote for federal elections.
- The table summarizes the results from the quantitative text analysis of ChatGPT's responses to the political statements from the two voting advice applications using LIWC and TextAnalyzer (N = 38 for the Wahl-O-Mat and N = 30 for the StemWijzer).
- LIWC scores are scaled from 0 to 100 (see https://www.liwc.app/help/ psychometrics-manuals).
- The scales of the TextAnalyzer scores vary across dimensions (see http://textanalyzer.org/lexica).
- We translated all statements using the software DeepL.

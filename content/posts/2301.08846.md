# Abstract
- Machine learning methods are used to build a mapping from source data to target data.
- Target data is high-dimensional and complex, making it difficult to learn the mapping.
- Regeneration learning is a learning paradigm that generates an abstraction of the target data, then uses it to generate the target data.
- Regeneration learning is a counterpart of traditional representation learning.
- Regeneration learning can be used for various data generation tasks.

# Paper Content

## Formulations of regeneration learning
- Regeneration learning bridges the information mismatch between X and Y.
- Regeneration learning has three steps.

### Connections to other methods
- Template-based methods extract template from target data and regenerate target data from template
- Vocoding methods convert speech waveform to spectrograms and regenerate waveform from spectrograms
- Grapheme/phoneme conversions convert text/character sequence to phoneme sequence and regenerate text/character sequence from phoneme sequence
- Auto-encoding methods convert target data to representations and regenerate target data from representations
- Easy Mapping learning is a sequence-to-sequence task where X and Y contain comparable information
- Denoising diffusion probabilistic models add noise to original data Y
- Iterative-based non-autoregressive sequence generation is an extended version of regeneration learning
- Post-refine methods improve quality of generated Y but not considered regeneration learning

### Regeneration learning vs. representation learning
- Regeneration learning is a type of representation learning for data generation
- Regeneration learning and traditional representation learning are counterparts of each other
- Regeneration learning handles abstraction of target data for data generation, traditional representation learning handles abstraction of source data for understanding
- Both processes can be learned in a self-supervised way
- Mapping from X to Y is simpler in regeneration and traditional representation learning than direct mapping from X to Y

## Applications of regeneration learning
- Text-to-Speech Synthesis
- Automatic Speech Recognition
- Text Generation
- Melody Generation
- Talking-Head Video Synthesis
- Image/Video/Sound Generation
- Regeneration Learning used when target data is too high-dimensional or complex, source and target data have uncorrelated information, or lack of paired data

## Research opportunities on regeneration learning
- RQ1: How to learn Y from Y?
- RQ2: How to design better learning paradigms to learn Y?
- RQ6: How to determine the format of Y?
- RQ7: How to design better generative models to learn X → Y and Y → Y mapping?
- RQ8: How to leverage the assumption of semantic conversion and detail rendering?
- RQ9: How to leverage self-supervised learning for Y → Y mapping?
- RQ10: How to reduce the training-inference mismatch in regeneration learning?

## Conclusion
- Presentation of a learning paradigm called regeneration learning for data generation tasks
- Regeneration learning handles the abstraction of the target data for data generation while representation learning handles the abstraction of source data for data understanding
- Connections of regeneration learning to other methods
- Variety of data generation tasks that can benefit from regeneration learning
- Comparison between regeneration learning and traditional representation learning on X → Y
- How to learn X → Y and Y → Y
- How to reduce training-inference mismatch in X → Y → Y
- Generate target Y from Y
- Infer Y from X via Y
- Typical data generation tasks that leverage regeneration learning

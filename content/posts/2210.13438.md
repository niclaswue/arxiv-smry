# Abstract
- State-of-the-art real-time, high-fidelity audio codec
- Leveraging neural networks
- Simplifying and speeding up training by using a single multiscale spectrogram adversary
- Weight of a loss now defines the fraction of the overall gradient it should represent, decoupling the choice of this hyper-parameter from the typical scale of the loss
- lightweight Transformer models can be used to further compress the obtained representation by up to 40%

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Streaming audio and video have accounted for the majority of the internet traffic in 2021
- Lossy signal compression is an increasingly important problem
- Audio codecs typically employ a carefully engineered pipeline combining an encoder and a decoder to remove redundancies in the audio content and yield a compact bitstream
- Traditionally, this is achieved by decomposing the input with a signal processing transform and trading off the quality of the components that are less likely to influence perception
- Leveraging neural networks as trained transforms via an encoder-decoder mechanism has been explored
- The problems arising in lossy neural compression models are twofold: first, the model has to represent a wide range of signals, such as not to overfit the training set or produce artifact laden audio outside its comfort zone
- We solve this by having a large and diverse training set (described in Section 4.1), as well as discriminator networks (see Section 3.4) that serve as perceptual losses, which we study extensively in Section 4.5.1, Table 2
- But the evaluation of lossy audio codecs necessarily relies on human perception, so we ran extensive human evaluation for multiple points in this design space, both for speech and music
- Those evaluations (MUSHRA) consist in having humans listen to, compare, and rate excerpts of speech or music compressed with competitive codecs and variants of our method, and the uncompressed ground truth
- Our best model, EnCodec , reaches state-of-the-art scores for speech and for music at 1.5, 3, 6, 12 kbps at 24 kHz, and at 6, 12, and 24 kbps for 48 kHz with stereo channels

## Related Work
- Recent advancements in neural audio generation enabled computers to efficiently generate natural sounding audio.
- The first convincing results were achieved by autoregressive models such as WaveNet (Oord et al., 2016), at the cost of slow inference.
- While many other approaches were explored (Yamamoto et al., 2020a;Kalchbrenner et al., 2018;Goel et al., 2022), the most relevant ones here are those based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) (Kumar et al., 2019;Yamamoto et al., 2020a;Kong et al., 2020;Andreev et al., 2022) were able to match the quality of autoregressive by combining various adversarial networks operate at different multi-scale and multi-period resolutions.
- Our work uses and extends similar adversarial losses to limit artifacts during audio generation.
- Audio Codec.
- Low bitrate parametric speech and audio codecs have long been studied (Atal & Hanauer, 1971;Juang & Gray, 1982), but their quality has been severely limited.
- Despite some advances (Griffin & Lim, 1985;McCree et al., 1996), modeling the excitation signal has remained a challenging task.
- The current state-of-the-art traditional audio codecs are Opus (Valin et al., 2012) and Enhanced Voice Service (EVS) (Dietz et al., 2015).
- These methods produce high coding efficiency for general audio while supporting various bitrates, sampling rates, and real-time compression.
- Neural based audio codecs have been recently proposed and demonstrated promising results (Kleijn et al., 2018;Valin & Skoglund, 2019b;Lim et al., 2020;Kleijn et al., 2021;Zeghidour et al., 2021;Omran et al., 2022;Lin et al., 2022;Jayashankar et al., 2022;Li et al.;Jiang et al., 2022), where most methods are based on quantizing the latent space before feeding it to the decoder.
- In Valin & Skoglund (2019b), an LPCNet (Valin & Skoglund, 2019a) vocoder was conditioned on hand-crafted features and a uniform quantizer.
- Gârbacea et al. (2019) conditioned a WaveNet based model on discrete units obtained from a VQ-VAE (Van Den Oord et al., 2017;Razavi et al., 2019) model, while Skoglund & Valin (2019) tried feeding the Opus codec (Valin et al., 2012) to a WaveNet to further improve its perceptual quality.
- Jayashankar et al. (2022); Jiang et al. (2022) propose an auto-encoder with a vector quantization layer applied over the latent representation and minimizing the reconstruction loss, while Li et al. suggested using Gumbel-Softmax (GS) (Jang et al., 2017) for representation quantization.
- The most relevant related work to ours is the SoundStream model (Zeghidour et al., 2021), in which the authors propose a fully convolutional encoder decoder architecture with a Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) (Gray, 1984;Vasuki & Vanathi, 2006) layers.
- The model was optimized using both reconstruction loss and adversarial perceptual losses.

## Model
- An audio signal of duration d can be represented by a sequence x ∈ [−1, 1] Ca×T with C a the number of audio channels, T = d • f sr the number of audio samples at a given sample rate f sr .
- The EnCodec model is composed of three main components: (i) First, an encoder network E is input an audio extract and outputs a latent representation z; (ii) Next, a quantization layer Q produces a compressed representation z q , using vector quantization; (iii) Lastly, a decoder network G reconstructs the time-domain signal, x, from the compressed latent representation z q .
- The whole system is trained end-to-end to minimize a reconstruction loss applied over both time and frequency domain, together with a perceptual loss in the form of discriminators operating at different resolutions.

### Encoder & Decoder Architecture
- The encoder model E consists of a 1D convolution with C channels and a kernel size of 7 followed by B convolution blocks.
- Each convolution block is composed of a single residual unit followed by a down-sampling layer consisting of a strided convolution with a kernel size of K of twice the stride S.
- The residual unit contains two convolutions with kernel size 3 and a skip-connection.
- The encoder model E is followed by a two-layer LSTM for sequence modeling and a final 1D convolution layer with a kernel size of 7 and D output channels.
- Following Zeghidour et al. (2021), Li et al. (2021) we use C = 32, B = 4 and (2, 4, 5, 8) as strides.
- We use ELU as a non-linear activation function (Clevert et al., 2015) either layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016) or weight normalization (Salimans & Kingma, 2016).
- We use two variants of the encoder model depending on whether we target the low-latency streamable setup or a high fidelity non-streamable usage.
- With this setup, the encoder outputs 75 latent steps per second of audio at 24 kHz, and 150 at 48 kHz.
- The decoder mirrors the encoder, using transposed convolutions instead of strided convolutions, and with the strides in reverse order as in the encoder, outputting the final mono or stereo audio.

### Residual Vector Quantization
- RVQ is a quantization scheme that is used to encode the output of the encoder
- The encoder is followed by a residual vector quantization scheme
- The encoder is followed by a gradient descent algorithm to update the codebook entries
- The encoder is followed by a straight-through estimator to compute the gradient
- A commitment loss is added to the overall training loss

### Language Modeling and Entropy Coding
- We use a range based arithmetic coder to encode the entropy
- We round the estimated probabilities with a precision of 10-6
- We use a total range width of 2 24

### Training objective
- The reconstruction loss term is comprised of a time and a frequency domain loss term.
- We minimize the L1 distance between the target and compressed audio over the time domain, i.e. t (x, x) = x − x 1 .
- For the frequency domain, we use a linear combination between the L1 and L2 losses over the mel-spectrogram using several time scales (Yamamoto et al., 2020b;Gritsenko et al., 2020).
- Formally, where S i is a 64-bins mel-spectrogram using a normalized STFT with window size of 2 i and hop length of 2 i /4, e = 5, . . . , 11 is the set of scales, and α represents the set of scalar coefficients balancing between the L1 and L2 terms.
- Unlike Gritsenko et al. (2020), we take α i = 1.
- To further improve the quality of the generated samples, we introduce a perceptual loss term based on a multi-scale STFT-based (MS-STFT) discriminator, illustrated in Figure 2.
- The MS-STFT discriminator consists in identically structured networks operating on multi-scaled complex-valued STFT with the real and imaginary parts concatenated.
- Each sub-network is composed of a 2D convolutional layer (using kernel size 3 x 8 with 32 channels), followed by 2D convolutions with increasing dilation rates in the time dimension of 1, 2 and 4, and a stride of 2 over the frequency axis.
- A final 2D convolution with kernel size 3 x 3 and stride (1, 1) provide the final prediction.
- We use 5 different scales with STFT window lengths of [2048,1024,512,256,128].
- At 24 kHz, we train the model to support the bandwidths 1.5, 3, 6, 12, and 24 kbps by selecting the appropriate number of codebooks to keep in the RVQ step, as explained in Section 3.2.
- At 48 kHz, we train to support 3, 6, 12 and 24 kbps.
- We also noticed that using a dedicated discriminator per-bandwidth is beneficial to the audio quality. Thus, we select a given bandwidth for the entire batch, and evaluate and update only the corresponding discriminator.
- If i λ i = 1, then each weight can be interpreted as the fraction of the model gradient that come from the corresponding loss.

## Experiments and Results

### Dataset
- We train EnCodec on 24 kHz monophonic across diverse domains, namely: speech, noisy speech, music and general audio
- For speech, we use the clean and with entropy coding (hollow). Lyra-v2 is a neural audio codec, while EVS and Opus are competitive standard codecs.
- The audio samples are from speech and music.
- The ground truth is 16bits 24kHz wave.
- speech segments from DNS Challenge 4 (Dubey et al., 2022) and the Common Voice dataset (Ardila et al., 2019).
- For general audio, we use on AudioSet (Gemmeke et al., 2017) together with FSD50K (Fonseca et al., 2021).
- For music, we rely on the Jamendo dataset (Bogdanov et al., 2019) for training and evaluation and we further evaluate our models on music using a proprietary music dataset.
- Data splits are detailed in Appendix A.1.
- For training and validation, we define a mixing strategy which consists in either sampling a single source from a dataset or performing on the fly mixing of two or three sources.
- Specifically, we have four strategies: (s1) we sample a single source from Jamendo with probability 0.32; (s2) we sample a single source from the other datasets with the same probability; (s3) we mix two sources from all datasets with a probability of 0.24; (s4) we mix three sources from all datasets except music with a probability of 0.12.

### Baselines
- Opus is a versatile speech and audio codec standardized by the IETF in 2012
- EVS is a codec standardized in 2014 by 3GPP and developed for Voice over LTE (VoLTE)
- Opus and EVS are used as traditional digital signal processing baselines
- MP3 compression at 64 kbps is used as an additional baseline for the stereophonic signal compression case
- Opus and EVS are compared to the SoundStream model from the official implementation available in Lyra 21 at 3.2 kbps and 6 kbps on audio upsampled to 32 kHz
- Opus and EVS are also reproduced with minor improvements, namely layer normalization (applied separately for each time step) in the discriminators

### Evaluation Methods
- We consider both subjective and objective evaluation metrics.
- For the subjective tests we follow the MUSHRA protocol (Series, 2014), using both a hidden reference and a low anchor.
- Annotators were recruited using a crowd-sourcing platform, in which they were asked to rate the perceptual quality of the provided samples in a range between 1 to 100.
- We randomly select 50 samples of 5 seconds from each category of the the test set and force at least 10 annotations per samples.
- To filter noisy annotations and outliers we remove annotators who rate the reference recordings less then 90 in at least 20% of the cases, or rate the low-anchor recording above 80 more than 50% of the time.
- For objective metrics, we use ViSQOL (Hines et al., 2012;Chinen et al., 2020) and the Scale-Invariant Signal-to-Noise Ration (SI-SNR) (Luo & Mesgarani, 2019;Nachmani et al., 2020;Chazan et al., 2021).

### Training
- Trains all models for 300 epochs
- Uses 8 A100 GPUs
- Uses the balancer introduced in Section 3.4 with weights λ t = 0.1, λ f = 1, λ g = 3, λ feat = 3 for the 24 kHz models, and λ g = 4, λ feat = 4 for the 48 kHz model

### Results
- EnCodec outperforms all evaluated baselines in terms of MUSHRA score
- When considering the same bandwidth, EnCodec is superior to Lyra-v2 using 6kbps and Opus at 12kbps
- Streamable setup is more efficient than non-streamable setup
- The balancer significantly stabilizes the training process

### Latency and computation time
- The initial latency is 13.3 ms for the 24 kHz streaming EnCodec model and 1 second for the 48 kHz non-streaming version.
- The real time factor is 10 times faster than real time.
- The gain from the entropy coding comes at a cost, although the processing is still faster than real time and could be used for applications where latency is not essential (e.g. streaming).

## Conclusion
- We presented EnCodec, a state-of-the-art real-time neural audio compression model, producing high-fidelity audio samples across a range of sample rates and bandwidth.
- We showed subjective and objective results from 24kHz monophonic at 1.5 kbps (Figure 3) to 48kHz stereophonic (Table 4).
- We improved sample quality by developing a simple but potent spectrogram-only adversarial loss which efficiently reduces artifacts and produce high-quality samples.
- Besides, we stabilized training and improved the interpretability of the weights for losses through a novel gradient balancer.
- Finally, we also demonstrated that a small Transformer model can be used to further reduce the bandwidth by up to 40% without further degradation of quality, in particular for applications where low latency is not essential (e.g. music streaming).

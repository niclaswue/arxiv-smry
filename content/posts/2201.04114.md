# Abstract
- DM-VIO is a monocular visual-inertial odometry system that uses two novel techniques called delayed marginalization and pose graph bundle adjustment
- Delayed marginalization is a popular strategy to keep the update time constrained, but it cannot easily be reversed
- To overcome this, we propose delayed marginalization: The idea is to maintain a second factor graph, where marginalization is delayed
- This allows us to later readvance this delayed graph, yielding an updated marginalization prior with new and consistent linearization points
- In addition, delayed marginalization enables us to inject IMU information into already marginalized states
- Our pose graph bundle adjustment is able to capture the full photometric uncertainty, improving the scale estimation
- After IMU initialization is complete, we continue to optimize scale and gravity direction

# Paper Content

## I. INTRODUCTION

## II. RELATED WORK
- Most visual odometry and SLAM systems have been feature-based
- Direct methods have been proposed, which optimize a photometric error function and can operate on dense, semi-dense, or sparse point clouds
- Mourikis and Roumeliotis have shown that a tight integration of visual and inertial measurements can greatly increase accuracy and robustness of odometry
- Afterwards, many tightly-coupled visual-inertial odometry and SLAM systems have been proposed
- Initialization of monocular visual-inertial systems is not trivial, as sufficient motion is necessary for the scale to become observable
- Most systems start with a visual-only system and use its output for a separate IMU initialization
- In contrast to these systems, we propose a separate IMU initializer, delayed marginalization as a better alternative to dynamic marginalization, a dynamic photometric error weight, and more improvements, resulting in greatly improved accuracy and robustness

## III. METHOD

## A. Notation
- We denote vectors as bold lowercase letters x, matrices as bold upper-case letter H, scalars as lowercase letters λ, and functions as uppercase letters E.
- T V w cami ∈ SE(3) represents the transformation from camera i to world in the visual coordinate frame V , and R V w cami ∈ SO(3) is the respective rotation.
- Poses are represented either in visual frame P V i := T V cami w , or in inertial frame P I i := T I w imui .
- If not mentioned otherwise we use poses in visual frame P i := P V i .
- We also use states s, which can contain transformations, rotations, and vectors.
- For states we define the subtraction operator s i s j , which applies log(R i R −1 j ) for rotations and other Lie group elements, and a regular subtraction for vector values.

## B. Direct Visual-Inertial Bundle Adjustment
- DM-VIO uses a direct formulation of the DSO algorithm to calculate the visual part of the bundle adjustment.
- Dynamic photometric weight is used to counteract bad image quality, which can lead to large photometric residuals.
- The photometric error is based on [17], and the photometric energy is optimized using active keyframes.
- Scale and gravity direction are optimized as explicit variables.
- The IMU preintegration is applied to the IMU state to generate a prediction for the following state.
- The Schur complement is used to marginalize old variables.

## D. Delayed Marginalization
- Delayed marginalization circumvents the drawbacks of marginalization while retaining the advantages.
- Delayed marginalization enables us to: • Effectively undo part of the marginalization to capture the full photometric probability distribution for the pose graph bundle adjustment (section III-E). • Update the initially visual-only marginalization prior with IMU information after the IMU initialization. • Relinearize variables in the Markov blanket while keeping all visual and most inertial information.
- The idea of delayed marginalization is that marginalization cannot be undone, but it can be delayed: In addition to the normal marginalization prior we also maintain a second, delayed marginalization prior and corresponding factor graph. In this delayed graph, marginalization of frames is performed with a delay of d. Points are still marginalized at the same time in the delayed graph, resulting in linearized photometric factors. We note that the same marginalization order as in the original graph is preserved. Switching to a fixed-lag smoother for this graph would immediately lead to a much larger Markov blanket jeopardizing the runtime of the system.

## E. Pose Graph Bundle Adjustment for IMU Initialization
- PGBA utilizes delayed marginalization for IMU initialization.
- The idea is to populate the delayed graph with IMU factors and optimize all variables.
- Populating the graph: Let a frame P i be directly connected to the newest pose P k iff all poses P j , i < j < k have not been marginalized yet.
- We determine the first frame P conn in the delayed graph which is still directly connected to the newest frame.
- In Fig. 2c this is P 2 .
- From there, we insert IMU factors and bias factors to all successive frames.
- We cannot start before P conn because we do not want to insert IMU factors between non-successive keyframes.
- As the marginalization order is not fixed-lag, this means that we have to optimize poses without corresponding IMU variables.
- It can be shown that there can be at most N f −2 poses without IMU variables.
- The reason is that all non-connected poses were at some point active at the same time. This means that in practice we have at least d−N f +2 poses for which we can add IMU data.
- In practice, we choose N f = 8 and delay d = 100, meaning that even in the worst case there will be 93 IMU factors in the optimization.
- As explained previously, fixed-lag smoothing would either result in a dense Hessian or in suboptimal performance of the visual system, so this is a very good trade-off.
- We optimize the graph with the GTSAM [29] library using the Levenberg-Marquardt optimizer with the provided Ceres-default settings.
- In this optimization all points are marginalized.
- We call it pose graph bundle adjustment because it is a combination of regular pose graph optimization (PGO) and bundle adjustment (BA).
- In contrast to BA, we do not update our estimates for point depths and do not relinearize photometric error terms.
- Different from PGO we do not use binary constraints between poses, but instead use "octonary" constraints, which connect N f frames and capture the full probability distribution of BA.
- Compared to PGO our solution is thus more accurate while being much faster than full BA.
- By using a fixed delay it is also constrained in runtime even though it can be performed at any time without losing any prior visual information.

## F. Robust Multi-Stage IMU Initialization
- Initializes only the unknown variables
- Most accurate result can be obtained by optimizing all variables jointly
- When marginalizing, connected variables have to be close to the optimum
- Inspired the Coarse IMU Initialization, PGBA, and Marginalization Replacement

## A. EuRoC dataset
- The EuRoC dataset is the most popular visual-inertial dataset to date
- Many powerful methods have been eval- Our method outperforms all other methods clearly in terms of RMSE.
- The closest competitor is Basalt [20], a stereo-inertial method which achieves a smaller error on 2 sequences.
- We also observe the lowest average scale error reported on the dataset so far, confirming that our contributions in IMU initialization have a positive impact on performance.
- In the supplementary we provide runtime evaluations, showing that tracking takes 10.34ms on average, and keyframe processing takes 53.67ms.

## B. TUM-VI dataset
- The TUM-VI dataset is a very challenging handheld dataset
- With long periods of walking in straight lines, stereo methods have an advantage here as they still can observe the scale with constant motion
- We compare to the state-of-the-art visual-inertial odometry methods evaluated in [8] in Table II. Our method clearly outperforms the other monocular method in VINS-Mono [3] on most sequences, and even compared to the stereo methods it shows the best result on 16 sequences and a mean drift of 0.472.
- The closest competitor is again Basalt, which achieves the best result on 8 sequences and a mean drift of 0.939.
- On this dataset, we also evaluate against ORB-SLAM3 [5], which is the state-of-the art visual-inertial SLAM system. This is not entirely fair as ORB-SLAM3 uses loop closures
- We find the comparison still helpful as it allows to make conclusions regarding the underlying odometry.
- We have evaluated ORB-SLAM3 5 times on each sequence and reproduced their results with code and settings provided by the authors.

## C. 4Seasons dataset
- The 4Seasons dataset is a recent automotive dataset
- The lower part of the images is obstructed by the car hood, hence we crop off the bottom 96 pixels
- We have manually read off the accelerometer and gyroscope noise density and bias random walk from the Allan variance plot provided in the data sheet of the IMU
- To handle unmodeled effects we follow [8] and inflate noise values by different amounts to determine the best setting for all methods
- For each method we tried noise models inflated by 1, 10, 100, 1000 respectively and chose the configuration which gave best results
- For VI-DSO and for our method we slightly modified the visual initializer by adding a zeroprior to the translation on the x and y axis, and also added a threshold to stop keyframe creation for translations smaller than 0.01m
- Otherwise, parameters are the same as for the other experiments
- After choosing the configuration for each method, we perform one final evaluation, running all 30 sequences 5 times each
- The results are shown in Fig. 5

## V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
- We provide a monocular visual-inertial odometry system which outperforms the state of the art, even stereoinertial methods.
- Thanks to a novel IMU initializer, it works well in flying, handheld, and automotive scenarios, extending the applicability of monocular methods.
- The foundation of our IMU initialization is delayed marginalization, which also enables the pose graph bundle adjustment.
- We anticipate that this method will spark further research in this direction.
- The idea of delayed marginalization could be applied to more use cases, e.g. for reactivating old keyframes in a marginalization setting to enable map reuse.
- The pose graph bundle adjustment can also be applied to long-term loop closures.
- Lastly, our open-source system is easily extendible, as all optimizations are integrated with GTSAM, allowing to quickly add new factors.

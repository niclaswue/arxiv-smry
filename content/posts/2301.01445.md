# Abstract
- Regulatory networks depict promoting or inhibiting interactions between molecules in a biochemical system
- We introduce a category-theoretic formalism for regulatory networks, using signed graphs to model the networks and signed functors to describe occurrences of one network in another, especially occurrences of network motifs
- With this foundation, we establish functorial mappings between regulatory networks and other mathematical models in biochemistry
- We construct a functor from reaction networks, modeled as Petri nets with signed links, to regulatory networks, enabling us to precisely define when a reaction network could be a physical mechanism underlying a regulatory network
- Turning to quantitative models, we associate a regulatory network with a Lotka-Volterra system of differential equations, defining a functor from the category of signed graphs to a category of parameterized dynamical systems
- We extend this result from closed to open systems, demonstrating that Lotka-Volterra dynamics respects not only inclusions and collapsings of regulatory networks, but also the process of building up complex regulatory networks by gluing together simpler pieces. Formally, we use the theory of structured cospans to produce a lax double functor from the double category of open signed graphs to that of open parameterized dynamical systems. Throughout the paper, we ground the categorical formalism in examples inspired by systems biology.

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Regulatory networks are a kind of directed graph in which vertices represent molecules and edges represent interactions between molecules.
- Regulatory networks are the subject of a large body of experimental and theoretical work.
- Category theory is a powerful tool for describing the structure of complex systems, and it has been used to study a wide range of biological phenomena.
- In Section 4, we use category theory to formalize the concept of a motif, which is a recurrent pattern of positive or negative interactions in a regulatory network.
- We show that motifs occur more frequently in networks with more edges and loops, and that they are associated with specific biochemical mechanisms.
- We also show that a network can be a mechanism for another network if and only if the functor between the two categories is a sign-preserving functor.

## Qualitative analysis: motifs and mechanisms

### Regulatory networks as signed graphs
- A signed graph is a graph with a set of signs, X(Sgn), and a function X(sgn) : X(E) → Sgn that assigns a sign to each edge.
- A morphism of signed graphs is a graph homomorphism that preserves signs.
- A signed graph is a mathematical description of the regulatory networks studied in systems biology.
- A signed graph is a category that is complete and cocomplete.
- To construct a symmetric monoidal double category, we use the method of structured cospans.

### Refining regulatory networks using signed categories and functors

### Mechanistic models as Petri nets with links

### Parameterized dynamical systems
- Pioneering the idea of functorial semantics for scientific models, Baez and Pollard extended the mass-action model of reaction networks to a functor from the category of Petri nets with rates into a category of dynamical systems [BP17].
- In this picture, the reaction rate coefficients are known constants associated with the reaction network.
- In practice, however, rate coefficients are often unknown and must be extracted from existing literature or estimated from experimental data.
- We therefore change our perspective slightly and consider dynamical systems not in isolation but as parameterized families.
- This shift also turns out to have formal advantages: the category of parameterized dynamical systems is better behaved than the category of dynamical systems, which has too few morphisms.
- To begin, we recall the dynamics functor, nearly identical to Baez-Pollard's [BP17, Lemma 15]: There is a functor Dynam : FinSet → Vect R that sends • a finite set S to the vector space of algebraic vector fields v : R S → R S , where algebraic means that the components of the vector field are polynomials in the state variables; • a function f : S → S between finite sets to the linear transformation where the linear map f * : R S → R S is the pullback along f and the linear map
- The dynamics functor is the same one studied by Baez and Pollard except that we take the vector space, rather than merely the set, of vector fields. That is because we are interested in linearly parameterized dynamical systems.
- In calling the functor "dynamics," we implictly identify a vector field with the differentiable dynamical system that it generates.
- While certainly not all dynamical models depend linearly on their parameters, a great many of them do, including several important canonical models in biology and chemistry.
- The law of mass action defines dynamical systems that depend linearly on the rate coefficients.
- The generalized Lotka-Volterra equations, studied in the next section, are linear in the rate and affinity parameters.
- Of course, the mass-action and Lotka-Volterra equations are nonlinear ODEs; linearity of a vector field in state or in parameters are separate matters. Nevertheless, even for nonlinear models such as Lotka-Volterra, linearity in parameters is a useful assumption that aides in the identifiability analysis of the model [SRS14,§5].
- To express important physical constraints and to define a semantics for signed graphs, we will restrict the dynamical system and its parameters to be nonnegative.
- This is straightforward enough but requires a bit of additional formalism.

### The Lotka-Volterra dynamical model
- A Lotka-Volterra system with n species has a vector field v(x; ρ, β) that is defined in terms of state vector x and parameters ρ and β.
- The vector field v(x; ρ, β) has state vector x and arbitrary real-valued parameters ρ and β.
- The parameter ρ sets the baseline rate of growth (when positive) or decay (when negative) for species i, whereas β i,j defines a promoting (when positive) or inhibiting (when negative) effect of species j on species i.
- In typical applications, the signs of the parameters ρ and β are fixed and known in advance.
- For a more interesting example, a quantitative semantics for signed graphs can be defined in terms of the morphism LV(p).
- The morphism LV(p) sends the parameterized dynamical system with state variables {R, * } and parameters ρ, β ∈ R {R, * } + , in two different but equivalent ways.
- The equivalence of these operations is precisely the condition for LV(p) to be a morphism of parameterized dynamical systems.

### Composing Lotka-Volterra models
- The Lotka-Volterra dynamics functors between graphs and parameterized dynamical systems, constructed in Theorems 3. whose apex is the set S of state variables;
- as cells, morphisms of such open systems (P, S, v, 0 , 1 ) → (P , S , v , 0 , 1 ), which consist of a morphism (q, f ) : (P, S, v) → (P , S , v ) between linearly parameterized dynamical systems along with functions f 0 : A 0 → A 0 and f 1 : A 1 → A 1 making the diagram commute: Vertical composition is by composition in FinSet and in Para(Dynam). Horizontal composition and monoidal products are by pushouts and coproducts in Para(Dynam), respectively, interpreting the finite sets in the feet of the cospans as linearly parameterized dynamical systems with no parameter variables and identically zero vector fields.
- Similarly, there is a symmetric monoidal double category Open(Para(Dynam + )) of open conically parameterized nonnegative dynamical systems.
- Proof. We perform the construction for linearly parameterized dynamical systems. The construction for conically parameterized nonnegative dynamical systems is perfectly analogous, replacing R with R + and vector spaces with conical spaces.
- The projection functor π S : Para(Dynam) → FinSet, (P, S, v) → S that sends a linearly parameterized dynamical systems to its set of state variables has a left adjoint Z : FinSet → Para(Dynam) that sends a finite set S to the system (∅, S, 0) with empty set of parameter variables. By linearity, its parameterized vector field 0 ∼ = R ∅ → Dynam(S) is necessarily the zero vector field. This indeed gives an adjunction Z π S , because to any function f : S → S and linearly parameterized dynamical system (P , S , v ) there corresponds a unique morphism (0 P , f ) : Z(S) → (P , S , v ), where the required square 0 Dynam(S) commutes trivially, since the zero vector space is initial in Vect R .
- Since Para(Dynam) has finite colimits (Proposition 3.5), we can construct a symmetric monoidal double category of Z-structured cospans [BC20, Theorem 3.9].
- As we have argued before, it will be isomorphic to Open(Para(Dynam)). With this definition, we can construct double functors between open graphs and open parameterized dynamical systems, but the vertex parameters under Lotka-Volterra dynamics cause a twist in the story compared to Baez and Pollard's compositionality result for mass-action kinetics [BP17,Theorem 18].
- When composing open dynamical systems in the image of the Lotka-Volterra functor, one takes a coproduct of the parameter variables, i.e., a direct sum of the parameter spaces, belonging to identified vertices. However, if one composes the open graphs first, then the identified vertices receive a single copy of the parameters from the Lotka-Volterra functor. Thus this functor does not preserve composition of open systems, not even up to isomorphism.
- Nevertheless, there is a natural (noninvertible) comparison between them: given a pair of parameters in the direct sum, we can reduce them to a single parameter simply by summing them. In mathematical terms, we get a lax double functor: a double functor that strictly preserves vertical composition, as usual, but preserves...

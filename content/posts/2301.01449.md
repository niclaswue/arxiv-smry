# Abstract
- Building coverage statistics provide crucial insights into the urbanization, infrastructure, and poverty level of a region, facilitating efforts towards alleviating poverty, building sustainable cities, and allocating infrastructure investments and public service provision.
- Global mapping of buildings has been made more efficient with the incorporation of deep learning models into the pipeline. However, these models typically rely on high-resolution satellite imagery which are expensive to collect and infrequently updated. As a result, building coverage data are not updated timely especially in developing regions where the built environment is changing quickly.
- In this paper, we propose a method for estimating building coverage using only publicly available low-resolution satellite imagery that is more frequently updated. We show that having a multi-node quantile regression layer greatly improves the model's spatial and temporal generalization. Our model achieves a coefficient of determination ($R^2$) as high as 0.968 on predicting building coverage in regions of different levels of development around the world. We demonstrate that the proposed model accurately predicts the building coverage from raw input images and generalizes well to unseen countries and continents, suggesting the possibility of estimating global building coverage using only low-resolution remote sensing data.

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Buildings provide important insights into human activities and urban development
- Building statistics are key socioeconomic indicators
- Detection- or segmentation-based methods typically rely on a large amount of high-resolution satellite imagery and the corresponding pixel-or instance-level labels for training, which are often prohibitively expensive and unaffordable for researchers and policymakers
- In this paper, we propose a cheaper and more generalizable way to update building statistics using only low-resolution satellite imagery from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2
- The proposed method achieves a coefficient of determination (R 2 ) as high as 0.968 in re-gions from different continents and of different levels of development.

## Method
- The proposed model accurately predicts building coverage in low-resolution satellite imagery
- The model does not require high-resolution training data or hand-crafted threshold
- The model generalizes well to unseen regions

### Problem Definition
- The computer science paper is trying to estimate the building coverage within a geographical region
- The computer science paper is using satellite images to estimate the building coverage
- The computer science paper is trying to build a model that predicts the building coverage from the raw image input

### Multi-node Quantile Regression Model
- We observe that the distribution of building pixel counts across Africa and South America are heavy-tailed, with more than 75% of the samples having less than 20% of all pixels being buildings.
- Regular linear regression trained on root-mean-square error objective estimates the conditional mean and assumes normality of the data distribution, failing to model non-normal asymmetric distribution accurately.
- Moreover, linear regression is not robust to outlier values, which characterize the building pixel count distribution for our task.
- To address the aforementioned problems, we adopt quantile regression (Koenker and Bassett Jr 1978), which estimates the conditional quantile (e.g., median) of the response variable.
- Quantile regression allows us to incorporate uncertainty in prediction and captures the relationship between the input and different quantiles of the data.
- As we will see in Section , multi-node quantile regression indeed empirically performed better than regular linear regression for our task.

### Multi-node Quantile Loss
- For each node that represents a quantile q ∈ (0, 1), we compute an asymmetric quantile loss, or pinball loss.
- Depending on the quantile q, over-and under-estimation are penalized unevenly.
- Specifically, the node-wise pinball loss for a given prediction ŷ and ground truth label y is computed as follows:
- When q = 0.5, the pinball loss is the same as the absolute error.
- To compute the final loss, we take the mean of the pinball losses among the K output nodes as follows:
- where the subscript n indicates the index of the quantile in the list of quantiles predicted by the model.

## Experiment Setup
- Tile and patch are defined
- Patch is the small rasters of 50×50 pixels that we crop larger rasters into
- Tile is a larger satellite imagery that could be cropped into multiple smaller patches
- Training and evaluating the multi-node quantile regression model on patches of 50 × 50 pixels
- Post-processing steps to collect tilelevel results

### Training Data
- The paper uses the Open Buildings dataset to derive the building coverage label
- The paper uses Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images to train a machine learning model
- The model is used to predict the building coverage label from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images

### Experiment Settings
- The model is evaluated on three experiment settings that capture likely cases of real-world application
- The model is evaluated on data points sampled across the African continent based on population density
- The model is evaluated on samples from the same country

### Baselines
- The proposed method uses existing settlement map products as baselines to compare against.
- GUF, GHSL, and WSF were collected in different years and contain different building coverage statistics.
- GUF and GHSL were collected using 2011 to 2012 data, while WSF was collected in 2015.

### Evaluation Settings
- The model is evaluated at patch-level and tile-level
- Mean absolute error (MAE) and Pearson's r 2 are used to evaluate the model
- Building coverage is evaluated at patch-level and tile-level
- Percentage of building pixels within a tile is used to evaluate the model

### Evaluation Data
- Evaluates the model on Open Buildings and SpaceNet 7 Challenge datasets
- Uses SpaceNet 7 Challenge tiles for validation
- Evaluates the model on six SpaceNet 7 tiles from different regions

## Results
- Tracking changes in building coverage across time allows us to understand the urban development of a region
- The proposed model can be used to track building coverage changes in regions of different levels of development
- The temporal experiment results in Figure 4 show that the proposed model can be used to track building coverage changes in regions of different levels of development.

### Accurate Prediction in Africa
- The proposed model achieves an R 2 as high as 0.968 at patch-level, outperforming the baselines on most of the African regions.
- Some examples of the proposed model's patch-level prediction are provided in Figure 3.
- Additionally, the proposed method yields fairly accurate building coverage estimates at tile-level, achieving a low error rate of 0.54% on Ghana.
- In contrast, the proposed method yields consistently accurate estimations at both tile-and patch-level.

### Generalization to Unseen Regions
- The proposed method generalizes well to regions not seen during training
- The proposed method achives an r 2 as high as 0.962 even with the test regions removed from the training set
- The proposed model generalizes to regions outside of the African continent

### Ablation Studies
- The proposed multi-node quantile regression model outperforms the single-node model by a large margin on all test regions
- At both patch-and tile-level, incorporating S1 band 1 and S2 band 8 boosts the performance

## Discussion and Social Impact
- Building coverage is an important socioeconomic indicator and also helps predict other indicators
- In this paper, we develop a framework for estimating building coverage using only free low-resolution satellite imagery from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2
- The proposed multi-node quantile regression model yields fairly accurate estimates and generalizes well to unseen countries and continents
- This paper offers a cost-efficient and generalizable way to collect global building coverage statistics, accelerating the progress towards multiple SDGs

### Training Details
- The models are trained on 15000 samples for 1200 epochs
- The models have fully converged at the point where we end training

### Temporal Experiments
- Evaluated the model's ability to track temporal changes in building coverage by running it on satellite images from 2016 and 2021
- Dhaka, Kampala, Athens, and Boston were chosen as the four cities
- The model was trained on 15,000 African images for 1200 epochs
- One challenge of temporal evaluation is the lack of building coverage ground truth data
- To get a sense of how well the proposed method tracks temporal changes in building coverage, we use population change as a proxy for building coverage change
- The model was accurate in estimating the results

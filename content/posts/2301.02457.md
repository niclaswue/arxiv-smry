# Abstract
- We consider the problem of computing differentially private approximate histograms and heavy hitters in a stream of elements.
- In the non-private setting, this is often done using the sketch of Misra and Gries [Science of Computer Programming, 1982].
- Chan, Li, Shi, and Xu [PETS 2012] describe a differentially private version of the Misra-Gries sketch, but the amount of noise it adds can be large and scales linearly with the size of the sketch: the more accurate the sketch is, the more noise this approach has to add.
- We present a better mechanism for releasing Misra-Gries sketch under $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy. It adds noise with magnitude independent of the size of the sketch size, in fact, the maximum error coming from the noise is the same as the best known in the private non-streaming setting, up to a constant factor. Our mechanism is simple and likely to be practical.
- It is sufficient to add noise to this new sketch with less than twice the magnitude of the non-streaming setting. This improves on the previous result for $\varepsilon$-differential privacy where the noise scales linearly to the size of the sketch.

## INTRODUCTION
- Computing the histogram of a dataset is one of the most fundamental tasks in data analysis.
- In practice, non-private approximate histograms are often computed using the Misra-Gries (MG) sketch.
- The MG sketch of size  returns at most  items and their approximate frequencies f such that f () ∈ [ () − /( + 1),  ()] for all elements  where  () is the true frequency and  is the length of the stream.
- The error of this algorithm is known to be optimal [8].
- In this work, we develop a way of releasing a MG sketch in a differentially private way while adding only a small amount of noise.
- This allows us to efficiently and accurately compute approximate histograms in the streaming setting while not violating users' privacy.
- Our result improves upon the work of Chan et al. [11] who also show a way of privately releasing the MG sketch, but who need a greater amount of noise.
- We get around this issue by exploiting the structure of the difference between the MG sketches for neighboring inputs.
- This allows us to prove that the following simple mechanism ensures (, )-differential privacy: (1) We compute the Misra-Gries sketch, (2) we add to each counter independently noise distributed as Laplace(1/), (3) we add to all counters the same value, also distributed as Laplace(1/), (4) we remove all counters smaller than 1 + 2 ln(3/)/.
- Specifically, we show that this algorithm satisfies the following guarantees: Theorem 11 (simplified).
- The above algorithm is (, )-differentially private, uses 2 words of space, and returns a frequency oracle f with maximum error of /( + 1) +  (log(1/)/) with high probability for  being sufficiently small.
- A construction for a differentially private Misra-Gries sketch has been given before by Chan et al. [11]. However, the more accurate they want their sketch to be (and the bigger it is), their approach has to add more noise.
- The reason is that they directly rely on the global ℓ 1 -sensitivity of the sketch. Specifically, if the sketch has size  (and thus error /( + 1) on a stream of  elements), its global sensitivity is , and they thus have to add noise of magnitude /.
- Their mechanism ends up with an error of  ( log()/) for -differential privacy with  being the universe size.
- This can be easily improved to  ( log(1/)/) for (, )-differential privacy with a thresholding technique similar to what we do in step (4) of our algorithm above.
- This also means that they cannot get more accurate than error Θ √︁  log(1/)/ , no matter what value of  one chooses.
- We achieve that the biggest error, as compared to the values from the MG sketch, among all elements is  (log(1/)/) assuming  is sufficiently small (we show more detailed bounds including the mean squared errors in Theorem 11).
- In fact, for any mechanism that outputs at most  heavy hitters there exists input with error at least /( + 1) in the streaming setting [8] and input with error at least  (log(min(, 1/))/) [4] under differential privacy.

## TECHNICAL OVERVIEW
- Misra-Gries sketch.
- The Misra-Gries sketch is a data structure that stores a sequence of elements.
- The Misra-Gries sketch can be released in a differentially private way.
- The Misra-Gries sketch can be released by adding noise to the stored items and then removing values smaller than an appropriately chosen threshold.
- The Misra-Gries sketch is differentially private because the ℓ 1 -sensitivity of the representation is < 2.

## PRELIMINARIES
- ∞ <  < ∞.

## RELATED WORK
- The global ℓ 1 -sensitivity of a Misra-Gries sketch is Δ 1 = .
- They achieve privacy by adding Laplace noise with scale / to all elements in the universe and keep the top- noisy counts.
- This gives an expected maximum error of  ( log()/) with -DP for  being the universe size.
- They use the algorithm as a subroutine for continual observation and merge sketches with an untrusted aggregator.
- Those settings are not a focus of our paper but our work can replace their algorithm as the subroutine when approximate differential privacy is acceptable.
- Böhler and Kerschbaum [7] worked on differential private heavy hitters with no trusted server by using secure multi-party computation.
- One of their algorithms adds noise to the counters of a Misra-Gries sketch.
- They avoid adding noise to all elements in the universe by removing noisy counts below a threshold which adds an error of  (log(1/)/).
- This is a useful technique for hiding differences in keys between neighboring sketches that removes the dependency on  in the error.
- Unfortunately, as stated in the introduction their mechanism uses the wrong sensitivity.
- The sensitivity of the sketch is .
- If the magnitude of noise and the threshold are increased accordingly the error of their approach is  ( log(/)/).
- If we ignore the memory restriction in the streaming setting, the problem is the same as the top- problem [10,13,22,25].
- The problem we solve can also be seen as a generalization of the sparse histogram problem.
- This has been investigated in [3,4,12,21].
- Notably, Balcer and Vadhan [4] provides a lower bound showing that for any (, )-differentially private mechanism that outputs at most  counters, there exists input such that the expected error for some elements is Ω(min(log(/)/, log(1/)/, )) (assuming  2 > ).
- The noise that we add in fact matches the second branch of the min over all elements.
- A closely related problem is that of implementing frequency oracles in the streaming setting under differential privacy.
- These approaches do not directly return the heavy hitters.
- The simplest approach for finding the heavy hitters is to iterate over the universe which might be unfeasible.
- However, there are constructions for finding heavy hitters with frequency oracles more efficiently (see Bassily et al. [5]).
- However, as we discussed in the introduction, the approach of [5] leads to worse maximum error than what we get unless the sketch size is very large and the universe size is small.
- The heavy hitters problem has also received a lot of attention in local differential privacy, starting with the paper introducing the RAPPOR mechanism [16] and continuing with [5,9,26,[28][29][30].
- This problem is practically relevant, it is used for example by Apple to find commonly used emojis [2].

## DIFFERENTIALLY PRIVATE MISRA-GRIES

## Privatizing standard versions of Misra-Gries
- The privacy of our mechanism relies on our variant of the Misra-Gries algorithm
- It is easy to change Algorithm 2 to handle these implementations
- Sketches for neighboring datasets can differ for up to keys if one sketch stores elements with a count of 1 and the other sketch is empty

## Tips for practitioners
- The output of the Misra-Gries algorithm is an associative array.
- In Algorithm 2, appropriate noise is added to ensure that the associative array can be released under differential privacy.
- However, for some implementations of associative arrays, the order in which keys are added affects the data structure.
- Using such an implementation naively violates differential privacy, but it is easily solved by outputting a random permutation of the key-value pairs or using a fixed order e.g. sorted by key.
- The distribution can be replaced by the Geometric mechanism or one of the alternatives introduced in [4] if the output of MG is discrete.
- However, a tighter analysis would improve the constant slightly which might matter for practical applications.

## PURE DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY
- Differential privacy is achieved by adding noise to all elements of U scaled to the ℓ 1 -sensitivity.
- The ℓ 1 -sensitivity scales with the size of the sketch since the counts can differ by 1 for all  elements between neighboring datasets.
- This happens when the decrement step is executed on a given input one fewer or one more time than on a neighboring input.
- We get around this case by post-processing the sketch before adding noise.
- First run the Misra-Gries algorithm on the stream but we count how many times the counters were decremented. That is, we count the number of times Branch 2 of Algorithm 1 was executed and denote this count as .
- We use this fact by first adding  and then subtracting /( + 1) from each counter in the sketch.
- We then remove all elements with negative counters.
- Although we increase the error of the sketch for some datasets, the worst-case error guarantee is still the same as each count has been decremented by at most /( + 1).
- Next, we show how this post-processing step reduces the ℓ 1 -sensitivity to 2.
- Let  ∼  ′ denote any pair of neighboring streams where  ′ is obtained by removing one element from .
- Consider the effect of running the following procedure on the Misra-Gries sketches for both streams:
- add  and  ′ to the counters of MG  and MG  ′ , respectively
- subtract | |/( + 1) from the counters in both sketches
- remove any negative counters from both sketches.
- It can be shown that the new sketches are either identical or differ by 1 in a single counter.
- Specifically, we may use the argument

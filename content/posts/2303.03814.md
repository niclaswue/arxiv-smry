# Abstract
- Markov state models are used to interpret molecular dynamics trajectories.
- Structurally distinct conformations are needed to understand the biomolecular process.
- Dihedral angles and interresidue distances are used as input coordinates.
- Contacts are used to define and select contact distances.
- Low-pass filtering and correlation-based characterization of states are used.
- States of the Markov model are discriminated by the features.

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- MSMs are popular for MD simulations
- Workflow to construct an MSM consists of: selection of suitable input coordinates, dimensionality reduction, clustering of low-dimensional data into metastable conformational states, and estimation of transition matrix
- Variational principle states that MSM producing slowest timescales represents best model
- Internal coordinates such as dihedral angles and interatomic distances are natural choice
- Interresidue distances number scales quadratically with number of residues
- Exclude irrelevant motions from analysis
- Correlation analysis termed MoSAIC block-diagonalizes correlation matrix
- Study on virtues and shortcomings of using contact distances or backbone dihedral angles
- Focusing on folding of villin headpiece (HP35)
- Employing 300 µs-long MD trajectory of HP35
- Comparing fraction of native contacts Q and sum Ψ over backbone dihedral angles ψi
- Contacts and dihedrals appear to monitor overall structural evolution of HP35
- Simulation data and intermediate results available on Github page

## Feature selection
- Conducted a 300 µs-long MD simulation of HP35
- Used Amber ff99SB*-ILDN force-field and TIP3P water model
- 1.5 × 10^6 data points collected

### Definition of contacts
- Conditions for contact established (distance cutoff)
- Choice of molecular structures (single crystal structure or MD structures)
- Definition of distance between residues (Cα-atoms or closest heavy atoms)
- Contact established if distance between closest non-hydrogen atoms is < 4.5 Å
- Residues must be more than 3 residues apart
- Contact must be populated > 30% of simulation time
- 42 native contacts found in MD trajectory
- Distance cutoff based on studies of distance distribution of proteins
- Exclude (n, n+3) contacts
- Fraction of native contacts highly correlated with RMSD of folding trajectory
- Exclude non-native contacts that are typically infrequent and short-lived
- Different choice of native contacts than crystal structure
- Appropriate calculation of contact distance crucial for modeling
- Exclude atom pairs that don't meet population cutoff of 0.3

### Correlation analysis of contacts
- Calculated linear correlation matrix to characterize contacts and detect interdependencies
- Blocked-diagonalized correlation matrix to associate blocks/clusters with functional motions
- Seven main clusters with high intracluster correlation and low correlation between different clusters
- Clusters follow protein backbone from N- to C-terminus
- Cluster 8 mostly represents helix-stabilizing contacts with shorter lifetimes than other clusters

### Selection of dihedral angles
- Number of dihedral angles scales linearly with number of residues
- Dihedral angles indicate whether protein forms helices, sheets or loops
- Convert angles to sine/cosine-transformed coordinates
- Ramachandran plot shows protein backbone dihedral angles are limited to specific regions
- Correlation matrix of dihedral angles shows ψ angles are more correlated than φ angles
- ψ angles correlate strongly with folding dynamics of HP35

## Construction of metastable states
- Employed Gaussian low-pass filter to eliminate high-frequent fluctuation of feature trajectory
- Used density-based clustering to generate microstates
- Used most probable path algorithm to lump microstates into macrostates
- Used projection method of Hummer and Szabo to construct transition matrix of metastable states

### Dimensionality reduction
- PCA is a linear transformation that removes linear correlations among variables
- First PCs account for largest correlation of data set
- Aim to obtain low-dimensional representation by truncating number of PCs
- First 5 PCs explain 80% of total correlation
- First PC mostly reflects fraction of native contacts

### Clustering
- Used robust density-based clustering to compute local free energy estimate for every frame of trajectory
- Reordered structures from low to high free energy to identify minima of free energy landscape
- Iteratively increased energy threshold to assign structures to same cluster until clusters meet at energy barriers
- Used hypersphere of radius 0.124 for contact distances and 0.072 for dihedral angles
- Used MPP algorithm to construct small number of macrostates
- Calculated transition matrix of microstates using lag time of 10 ns
- Self-transition probability of state lower than metastability criterion Qmin, state lumped with state to which transition probability is highest
- Repeated procedure for increasing Qmin to construct dendrogram showing topology and hierarchical structure of free energy landscape
- Obtained 12 metastable states for both contacts and dihedral angles

### Structural characterization of states
- Obtaining a useful state model requires structurally well-defined and long-lived or metastable states.
- Contact distances and dihedral angles are used to characterize the states.
- The states are ordered by decreasing fraction of native contacts.
- The first three states are structurally well-defined native-like states.
- The unfolded basin mainly consists of states 9 to 12, which show different degrees of disorder.
- The MoSAIC clusters provide a concise characterization of the structure of the metastable states.
- 6 contacts or 10 dihedrals are sufficient to discriminate all metastable states with high accuracy.

### Dynamical properties of states
- Calculate transition matrix to assess dynamical properties of states
- Diagonalize transition matrix to obtain eigenvalues and implied timescales
- Implied timescales should be constant for Markovian dynamics
- Probabilities reflect hydrophobic collapse, time in unfolded basin, and overall folding process
- Implied timescales level off for lag times of 10 ns
- Slowest timescale for contacts is 1.2 µs, for dihedrals is 0.7 µs
- Folding time defined as waiting time for transition from unfolded to native state
- MSM reproduces broad MD folding-time distributions
- Gaussian filtering improves implied timescales and structural characterization

## Results on the folding of hp35

### Ground truth observations
- MD simulation results include RMSD, native contacts, and sum of backbone dihedral angles
- Upper and lower thresholds of 2Å and 6Å for folded and unfolded conformations
- Free energy profile consists of two states, native and unfolded
- Transition path time is shorter than folding time
- Correlation between 1-Q and RMSD
- Sharp minimum for native state and shallow minimum for unfolded state in free energy profile
- Cooperative behavior of native contacts and dihedral angles
- Multiple folding pathways indicated by preferred but not mandatory cluster formation order
- Contact clusters and dihedral angles too coarse grained to accurately reproduce dynamics of system

### Kinetic network and folding pathways
- Constructed MSMs of HP35 found 12 metastable states with well-defined structures

## Discussion

### Feature selection: contacts vs. dihedrals
- Model problem of ultrafast folding of HP35 studied
- Dihedral angles used as features to construct MSM
- Dihedral angles require appropriate treatment and exclusion of uncorrelated motion
- Maximal-gap shifted (φ, ψ) dihedral angles used
- Dihedral angles report on local secondary structure
- Contact distances require selection and appropriate calculation
- Correlation analysis identifies seven clusters of contacts
- Contacts key to folding process, give better Markovian model than dihedrals

### Msm workflow: what matters?
- Selection of features is important
- PCA used to explain majority of correlation
- Robust density-based clustering used to construct microstates
- Gaussian low-pass filtering used to reduce spurious transitions
- Dendrograms used to reveal hierarchical structure of free energy landscape

## Concluding remarks
- Aim to construct structurally well-defined metastable states to understand biomolecular process
- Use correlation analysis to identify appropriate features
- Quality of state partitioning can be assessed by MPP dendrogram
- Dynamical corrections can improve Markovianity of MSM
- Check if resulting metastable states are structurally well characterized
- Decision tree-based machine learning to identify essential coordinates
- MSMs correctly reproduce slow timescales of process
- Kinetic networks and state trajectories obtained from contacts and dihedrals
- Preselection of backbone dihedral angles
- Structural characterization of metastable states

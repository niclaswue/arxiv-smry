# Abstract
- Molecular conformation generation (MCG) is an important problem in drug discovery
- Traditional methods have been developed to solve MCG, such as systematic searching, model-building, random searching, etc.
- Recently, deep learning based MCG methods have been developed
- A simple and cheap algorithm (parameter-free) based on traditional methods is comparable to or even outperforms deep learning based MCG methods
- Code of the proposed algorithm is available online

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Molecular conformation generation is important for drug discovery
- It is related to many drug design tasks
- Traditional MCG uses conformational search and energy minimization
- RDKit is a popular cheminformatics software
- Distance geometry and direct coordinate methods are used
- Diffusion models are also used
- Deep learning models are evaluated with Coverage and Matching
- A simple algorithm based on traditional approaches outperforms deep learning models

## Related work

- Development of deep learning
- Data-driven solutions proposed by researchers

### Classical methods
- Traditional MCG paradigm involves conformational search, energy minimization, and energy evaluation
- Conformational search problem is a combinatorial explosion problem
- Popular conformational search methods include system search, random search, model-building, distance geometry, and molecular dynamics
- Energy evaluation methods include force field and electronic structure methods
- Force field methods are less accurate than electronic structure methods, but are faster

### Deep learning methods
- Deep learning methods outperform traditional methods on the GEOM benchmark
- Earlier work used VAE to generate atomic coordinates directly, but it could not maintain translation and rotation equivariance
- Later works use intermediate structures such as interatomic distances or torsion angles to generate conformations
- Diffusion models have been applied to the conformation generation task

## Method
- Proposed a method based on RDKit with clustering post-processing
- Used three samplers to generate diverse and low-energy conformations
- Applied unsupervised cluster algorithm to select conformations with consideration of diversity and energy
- Sampled with uniform, geometric, and energy samplers in the ratio of 1:1:4

## Experiment
- Datasets and setup used for benchmarking
- 10 competitive baselines compared
- Results show method outperforms most baselines
- Ablation study conducted to demonstrate more diverse conformations can easily achieve better results
- Benchmarking should be done according to requirements of downstream applications

## Conclusion
- Algorithm outperforms deep learning models
- Suggest community rethink benchmark in MCG
- Deep learning can help build effective MCG models
- RDKit + Clustering algorithm proposed
- Performance on GEOM-QM9 and GEOM-Drugs
- Ablation studies for number of samples and sampler type on GEOM-QM9

# Abstract
- A generalized understanding of protein dynamics is an unsolved scientific problem
- The solution of which is critical to the interpretation of the structure-function relationships that govern essential biological processes.
- We approach this problem by constructing coarse-grained molecular potentials based on artificial neural networks and grounded in statistical mechanics.
- For training, we build a unique dataset of unbiased all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of approximately 9 ms for twelve different proteins with multiple secondary structure arrangements.
- The coarse-grained models are capable of accelerating the dynamics by more than three orders of magnitude while preserving the thermodynamics of the systems.
- Coarse-grained simulations identify relevant structural states in the ensemble with comparable energies to the all-atom systems. Furthermore, we show that a single coarse-grained potential can integrate all twelve proteins and can capture experimental structural features of mutated proteins. These results indicate that machine learning coarse-grained potentials could provide a feasible approach to simulate and understand protein dynamics.

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- A complete description of the dynamics of a protein requires the determination of its stable and metastable conformational states,
- The relative probabilities of these states and the rates of interconversion among them.
- Here, we focus on addressing the first two problems by demonstrating how to learn coarsegrained potentials that preserve protein thermodynamics.
- Due to the structural heterogeneity of proteins and the ranges of time and length scales over which their dynamics occur, there is no single technique that is able to successfully model protein behavior across the whole spatiotemporal scale.
- Computationally, the main method to study protein dynamics has traditionally been molecular dynamics (MD).
- The first MD simulation ever made was carried out in 1977 on the BPTI protein in vacuum, and only accounted for 9.2 picoseconds of simulation time.
- As remarked by Karplus & Mc-Cammon, these simulations were pivotal towards the realization that proteins are dynamic systems and that those dynamics play a fundamental role in their biological function.
- When compared with experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography, MD simulations may obtain a complete description of the dynamics in atomic resolution.
- This information can explain slow events at the millisecond or microsecond timescale, typically with a femtosecond time resolution.
- In the last several decades, there have been many attempts to better understand protein dynamics by long unbiased MD.
- For example, Lindorff-Larsen et al. and Piana et al. simulated several proteins that undergo multiple folding events over the course of micro-to millisecond trajectories, yielding crucial insights into the hierarchy and timescales of the various structural rearrangements.
- With current technological limitations, unbiased MD is not capable of describing longer-timescale events, such as the dynamics of large proteins or the formation of multi-protein complexes.
- Due to the computational cost and timescales involved, there are just a few exam-ples of modelling of such events, including folding of a dimeric protein Top7-CFr and all-atom computational reconstruction of protein-protein (Barnase-Barstar) recognition.
- Many methods have been developed to alleviate these sampling limitations, for instance, umbrella sampling, biased Monte Carlo methods and biased molecular dynamics like replica-exchange, steered MD and metadynamics.
- Recently, a new generative method based on normalizing flows has been proposed to sample structures from the Boltzmann distribution in "one-shot", thereby avoiding the many steps needed in MD to sample different metastable states.
- In general, a CG model consists of two parts: the selection of the CG resolution (or mapping) and the design of an effective energy function for the model once the mapping has been assigned.
- Although recent work has attempted to combine these two points, they are in general kept distinct.
- The choice of an "optimal" mapping strategy is still an open research problem
- Predictive capabilities of the NNP are demonstrated through simulation and analysis of selected mutants.

## Results and Discussion
- Multi-millisecond all-atom molecular dynamics dataset.
- We created a large-scale dataset of all-atom MD simulations by selecting twelve fastfolding proteins, studied previously by Kubelka et al. 58 and Lindorff-Larsen et al. 8 These proteins contain a variety of secondary structural elements, including α-helices and β-strands, as well as unique tertiary structures and various lengths from 10 to 80 amino acids.
- In the case of the shortest proteins, Chignolin and Trp-Cage (up to 20 amino acids), the secondary structure is quite simple.
- The dataset was generated by performing MD on each of the proteins starting from random coil conformations, simulating their whole dynamics and reaching the native structure.
- The total size of the dataset amounts to approximately 9 ms of simulation time across all proteins.
- The dataset is available for download as a part of Supporting Information.
- Coarse-grained neural network potentials.
- A common approach to bottom-up coarse-graining is to seek thermodynamic consistency; i.e. the equilibrium distribution sampled by the CG modeland thus all thermodynamic quantities computable from it, such as folding free energies-should match those of the all-atom model.
- Popular approaches to train thermodynamically consistent CG models are relative entropy minimization 59 and variational force matching. 27,60
- The latter has recently been developed into a machine-learning approach to train NNPs to compute the CG energy. 42,43 et D be a dataset of M coordinate-force pairs obtained using an all-atom MD force field.
- Conformations are given by r c ∈ R 3Nc , c = 1, . . . , M and forces by F(r c ) ∈ R 3Nc , where N c is the number of atoms in the system.
- The number of atoms N c depends on c as we wish to also have different protein systems in the dataset D.
- We define a linear mapping Ξ which reduces the dimensionality of the atomistic system x = Ξr ∈ R 3n , where n are the remaining degrees of freedom.
- For example, Ξ could be a simple map to α-carbon atom coordinates for each amino acid, to backbone coordinates or to the center of mass.
- We seek to obtain U (x c ; θ) : R 3n → R for any configuration c  2. parameterized in θ, such that to minimize the loss In order to reduce the conformational space accessible during the CG simulation and prevent the system from poor exploration, it is important to provide a prior potential.
- This also serves to reduce the complexity of the force field learning problem, and can equivalently be viewed as imposing physical biases from domain knowledge.
- The NNP is therefore performing a delta-learning between the all-atom forces and the prior forces.
- We applied bonded and repulsive terms to avoid rupture of the protein chain as well as clashing beads (Equations 11 and 12 in Supporting Information). Furthermore, we enforce chirality by introducing a dihedral prior term (Equation 13 in Supporting Information).
- This prevents the CG proteins from exploring mirror images of the na-tive structures.
- CG representations were created by retaining only certain atoms of each protein's all-atom representation; the retained atoms are referred to as CG "beads".
- NNPs were trained to predict forces based on the coordinates and identities of the beads, where the latter is represented as an embedding vector.
- Each CG bead comprises the αcarbon atom of its amino acid, and each amino acid was described by a unique bead type.
- In previous work,...

## Conclusion
- In this work, we combined coarse-grained with NNPs to model protein dynamics.
- The general model, trained over all proteins in the MD dataset, represents a step forward towards making NNPs transferable across molecular systems.
- Additionally, the mutagenesis study indicates that with a much larger and structurally diverse set of MD data, this approach might produce a general-use CG model capable of generalizing outside of its training set.
- There are a few limitations to the current approach. In general, machine learning potentials do not extrapolate well outside of the training set for atom positions that are never sampled in the training set. Therefore, unseen positions are assigned unrealistically low energies and often produce spikes in forces.
- This has been solved by limiting the physical sampled space with the use of basic prior energy terms.
- The network also relies on large datasets of all-atom molecular dynamics trajectories which are expensive to produce. Furthermore, the current accuracy of coarse-grained MD is limited by the accuracy of the underlying all-atom simulations.
- While all-atom force-fields are reasonably good for proteins, improved approaches are required for coarse-grained small molecules.
- Ultimately, the ability to create a general model that is transferrable from smaller to larger proteins would revolutionize the field. However, in order to learn transferable potentials, even larger molecular simulation datasets are needed.
- Current results indicate that this might be achievable.

# Paper Content

## I. introduction
- Smart cities are using digital twins to improve quality of life
- Global Burden of Disease study shows people are suffering from lower back pain due to sitting behaviors
- Sensing systems are needed to provide real-time feedback on sitting posture
- This paper presents a deep learning-powered chair to teach best sitting posture and provide feedback
- Chair uses pressure sensors to obtain pressure data and a spiking neural network to recognize sitting posture

## Ii. related work

## A. pressure sensing
- Pressure-mapping sensors are used to analyze weight-supporting surfaces in shoes, beds, and chairs.
- Examples of shoe studies include assessing pressure discomfort thresholds, pain thresholds, and tissue stiffness.
- Examples of bed studies include helping caregivers adjust bedridden patients and developing a monitoring framework.
- Examples of chair studies include monitoring sitting behavior, developing a driving assistant, and using pressure sensors to give feedback.

## B. smart chair
- Smart chair designed to process real-time information
- Includes chairs for different purposes, sensors, microcontrollers, and classification ability
- Can recognize 8-15 postures
- Includes feedback mechanism to alert user to risky posture

## C. spiking neural network
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are simulations of biological neural networks.
- Timing phenomena, such as time differences between spikes, are part of information-processing mechanisms in biological nervous systems.
- Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are the closest models to biological neural networks.
- Supervised learning algorithms for SNNs can be divided into gradient descent learning algorithms, supervised STDP learning algorithms, and learning algorithms based on spike sequence convolution.

## A. system description
- Designed hardware instrument and software interface for data acquisition
- 15 common sitting postures designed to be recognized
- Trained network to identify real-time sitting postures

## B. hardware description
- Chair composed of transducer, data collection, and calibration modules
- Transducer module includes interconnected sensors and actuator units
- Data collection module collects measured data from transducer module and passes to interface module
- Calibration module calibrates transducer units before each test

## C. software description
- User interface provides communication between chair and external environment
- Three communication media: USB, Bluetooth, ZigBee
- System supports Bluetooth and USB
- Data collection module exchanges data and control signals with posture classifier
- Posture classifier module receives sensor data, stores in database, analyzes, and informs user of posture
- Machine learning mechanism used to investigate poses and activate embedded actuators if posture is incorrect

## Iv. posture recognition approach a. spiking neuron and synapse
- Neurons in SNN determined by membrane potential and activation threshold
- Membrane potential determined by excitatory and inhibitory postsynapse potentials
- Neuron fires when membrane potential reaches activation threshold
- Neuron model used is Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF)
- Weight assigned to each synapse affects membrane potential of target neuron
- Liquid State Machine (LSM) is a type of recurrent neural network

## B. liquid state machine
- The LSM is composed of an input layer, liquid reservoir and readout layer.
- The liquid reservoir maps the signal from the input layer onto a liquid state.
- The readout layer is a detector that can be trained to recognize patterns from the liquid filter.

## C. encoding method
- Algorithm 1 is designed to encode pressure matrix data into a cosine-ranked 0/1 matrix with sparsity.
- Algorithm 1 maps the pressure matrix data to a range of [0, π] and adjusts the sparsity of the 0/1 matrix with scalar ratios A and n.

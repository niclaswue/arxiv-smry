# Paper Content

## Introduction
- antenna design is expensive and time-consuming due to the need for full-wave EM simulations
- there is a demand to design and optimize antennas that can unleash their full potential under the given space constraints
- computational antenna design heavily relies on full-wave EM simulations
- many works attempt to replace costly EM simulation with a lighter weight surrogate model, which trades off some degree of accuracy for computational efficiency
- the surrogate model is then used by a downstream optimization procedure
- in the EM based microwave circuit design, such as microwave filters, impedance-matching networks, multiplexers, etc., the equivalent-circuit, empirical, and semi-analytical models and combinations have been used as surrogate models with the links to the full-wave simulation
- the same approaches have been rarely applied to antenna modeling, due to the fact that the radiating structures are too complex to lend themselves to analytical and/or circuit modeling
- broadly, there are two approaches to antenna surrogate modeling, coarser approximate physics-driven simulation (Zhu et al., 2007;Koziel & Ogurtsov, 2013) or data-driven methods which model the computation performed by the simulator
- inspired by state-of-the-art mesh-based simulation techniques, we propose a novel image-based representation of antennas geometries that is both sampleefficient and captures the critical boundary information that is captured by high resolution meshes
- we show that the resonance characteristic of an antenna can be written analytically as the ratio of two complex-valued polynomials with a compact representation in terms of a constant, zeros and poles
- we propose a transformer architecture that first tokenizes the image representation and then directly predicts the complex valued zeros and poles of the S scattering matrix to compute the frequency response which we refer to as CZP
- experiments demonstrate the superiority of the CZP model over multiple baselines on test set loss
- when coupled with an optimization procedure like reinforcement learning, CZP can find antenna topologies that are verified by commercial EM modeling software to meet design specifications

## Antenna Preliminaries
- Define key notions and concepts
- Derive antenna design problem from traditional EM solvers
- CZP architecture is the theoretical innovation

### Antenna Parameterization
- An antenna design consists of the following components:
- The substrate, ground plane, and discrete port.
- The antenna contains M rectangular metallic patches which can freely move within the substrate area or pre-determined ranges.
- The m-th patch is defined by its width and height and, the coordinate of the bottom left corner.
- When the boundary of a metallic patch goes beyond the substrate, the excess is simply clipped.
- When patches overlap, there is no increase in the thickness; they combine to make a single metallic patch that is no longer rectangular.
- Combining all these specifications, we now have an overall design choice vector defined as which determines the antenna's frequency response described by the logarithm of modulus of the scattering coefficients log |S 11 (ω)|.
- S 11 (ω), as a function of frequency ω, is defined as the following: where Z in (ω) is the input impedance of the antenna, determined by the design vector h.
- Figure 1 shows an example antenna design and its S 11 (ω).
- The objective of antenna engineers is to find the right design choice h so that specific antenna design targets are met over the frequency bands of interest, for example, there needs to be dips (i.e., more absorption) in S 11 (ω) at WiFi 2.4GHz band and WiFi 5-7GHz band for WiFi 6E, as shown in Figure 1 bottom row.
- In this work, we consider an antenna example with an FR-4 substrate that is 30mm by 6mm and 5 front-side metallic patches with fixed dimensions and location boundaries (see Appendix for details).
- Additionally, we assume that the only degrees of freedom are the locations {s m,x , s m,y } of each of the 5 patches as defined by the coordinates of the bottom left corner.
- We constrain the problem as such for experimental simplicity and acknowledge this is a simplified setting with respect to production-tier antenna optimization.
- However, the proposed surrogate model is agnostic to the assumption on patches and the optimisation procedure can be easily extended to variable patches of varying dimensions.
- 3. An analytical formula of scattering coefficients S 11 (ω) is given.
- The relationship between an antenna's topology and its responses is governed by the well-known Maxwell's equations which can be written in the form of PDEs.
- When solving Maxwell's equations, traditional methods discretize the space and convert the PDEs into the following ODEs (Weiland, 1977): where the vector φ contain electromagnetic quantities (e.g., electric/magnitude field strength and potentials, voltages and currents, etc) at each grid cell.
- Note that φ is indexed by spatial location x: φ = [φ(x 1 ), φ(x 2 ), . . .] and thus is an infinite-dimensional vector in the continuous case and a vector of dimension N in finite difference methods.
- Finally, A(h) is a matrix of size N -by-N related to material properties h determined by the design, and topological structure of the discretized grid cells.
- For better understanding, here we put a concrete example of Eqn. 3.
- Consider a one-dimensional wave equation , the wave equation can be written in the form of Eqn. 3 with where B ∈ R N ×N spatially discretizes the operator ∂ 2 ∂x 2 .
- From the initial condition φ(...

## Network Architecture
- We propose a novel image representation for a 2D antenna inspired by the mesh representations commonly used by EM simulators.
- Following the analysis in the previous section, we introduce our image-based transformer architecture which predicts the zeros and poles of scattering coefficients.

### Image representation
- Mesh-based finite element methods underpin many of the available simulation tools in electromagnetics and other fields
- Mesh representations use the fact that an antenna's resonance characteristics are directly related to its local and global topological structure
- A model would have to cope with a naive representation (i.e. the coordinates of front-side metallic patches) by learning these spatial relationships
- Adaptive meshing enables the simulation of systems unsolvable by traditional discretization methods
- We propose a three channel image representation
- The first two channels provide the boundary locations in the x and y directions where pixel values v ∈ [0, 1] are floating point to represent the distance to the nearest pixel in the x or y directions, respectively
- For example, given the bottom left (x bl , y bl ) and top right (x tr , y tr ) floating-number coordinates of a rectangular patch, we compute the pixel indices as the floor, xbl = x bl , ȳbl = y bl , xtr = x tr , ȳtr = y tr . Then, we compute the values where v l , v r ,v b ,v t correspond to the left, right, bottom and top boundary values, respectively
- The left/bottom boundary is subtracted from 1 where as the right/top is not because the floor function has a subtly different semantic meaning between these cases; Without the loss of generality, the floor of the left/bottom boundary is not contained inside the interior of the patch whereas the floor of the right/top is.
- We chose this design as it enables sensible image dimensions (i.e. 60 × 300 for a 6mm ×30mm image with a resolution of 10 pixels to 1mm) however others are possible
- Finally, note, separating the x and y boundaries into two channels enables explicit representation of the corners of patches.
- Finally, a third channel provides the interior of the antenna as a binary image where v = 1 for all index pairs x, y such that x ∈ [x bl + 1, xtr − 1], y ∈ [ȳ bl + 1, ȳtr − 1] and v = 1.

### Surrogate Model
- The architecture is based on the Visual Transformer (Wu et al., 2020) which is motivated by the insight that local, spatial components such as boundaries between substrate of the antenna should be tokenized and then used by a transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) to compute the global characteristics.
- Given the input image I = I(h) ∈ R 3×HW as a function of design choice h, we first augment it with two additional channels of linearly spaced x and y coordinates (Liu et al., 2018), to yield augmented image Î ∈ R 5×HW .
- This is because the specific location of antenna components, in addition to its topology, determines the corresponding frequency response.
- Then, a CNN takes Î as an input and generates feature maps X ∈ R HW ×C where H, W and C are the height, width and channel dimension, respectively.
- A filter-based tokenizer (Zhang et al., 2019) generates L visual tokens T ∈ R L×C by mapping each pixel via a pointwise convolution to L groups with matrix W ∈ R C×L and computes a softmax in the pixel dimension where A ∈ R HW ×L is referred to as an attention map.
- Visual tokens T are computed via T = A T X which is the weighted average of pixels in the original feature map X.
- Intuitively, the tokens T capture semantics such as relative boundary and corner locations and from this the transformer computes the global characteristic of the antenna configuration.

### Model training
- When training CZP models, we do not have direct supervision to c 0 (h), zeros z(h), and poles p(h), but only the S 11 (ω) provided with CST Microwave Studio (CST, 2021) as ground truth.
- Therefore, we leverage Eqn. 4 to compute estimated S 11 (ω) with c 0 , z, and p, so that it can match the ground truth.
- We then train the model via back-propagation in an end-to-end manner to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE), for frequencies in the range [0.2 − 7.0]GHz at increments of 0.1 (i.e., 69 dimensions).
- We use a shrinkage loss (Li et al., 2018) variant of MSE as we found that with vanilla MSE, the model had higher error on the crucial parts of the scattering coefficients (i.e., the resonances).

## Experiments
- Our proposed image representation is a significant improvement over reasonable coordinate-based inputs as well as a naive binary image input.
- The CZP formulation outperforms raw prediction when using the same transformer architecture proposed in Section 4 and the proposed image representation.
- The transformer architecture outperforms a CNN for the image representation and an MLP for coordinate based input.
- CZP generalizes well to unseen antenna designs, not only on a held-out dataset, but also as a surrogate model for designs proposed by the reinforcement learning (RL) based search procedure, as verified to meet specific resonance requirements by commercial softwares.

### Surrogate Modeling
- We use 48K total samples, uniformly sampled and simulated with CST Microwave Studio (CST, 2021)
- Each sample takes between 90 and 120 seconds to simulate
- 90% of samples are used for training and 10% are used for testing
- From the training set, 10% are randomly sampled and used for validation
- Each experiment is run for 3 random seeds
- Appendix C provides all experimental hyperparameters
- Figure 3 illustrates the first set of experiments in which we demonstrate the effectiveness of (1) our novel image representation and (2) the proposed CZP when using the transformer architecture
- To show (1), we compare against a coordinate-based method which concatenates the normalized bottom-left x, y coordinate of each patch with a onehot vector to distinguish between patches
- When using the transformer architecture, this generates 5 tokens, each with dimension 7
- Before being processed by the transformer, each token is projected into a 256 dimensional vector by a 2-layer MLP with hidden layer of width 256
- Additionally, to demonstrate (2), for both coordinate and image input, we compare against directly predicting the raw 69 dimensional frequency response with a fully connected layer, referred to as Raw in figures
- Additionally, we ablate over different degree K of CZP with values 8, 12, 16, 20 and the number of attention layers L with values 8, 6, 4, 2
- First, within each configuration, the image representation improves over its coordinate counterpart by a minimum of 9.6% with L = 4 and raw prediction and a maximum of 26.8% with L = 2 and K = 12
- Second, for the image representation, CZP improves over raw prediction by a minimum of 9.2% with L = 8 and K = 12 and a maximum of 28.0% with L = 2 and K = 12
- For the coordinate representation, CZP improves over raw prediction by a minimum of 4.6% with L = 8 and K = 12 and a maximum of 25.1% with L = 2 and K = 8
- Increasing the transformer depth from 2 to 8 layers improves raw prediction for image and coordinate representations by 29.5% and 35.9%, respectively
- Increased depth improves the CZP an average of 15.4% and 20.9% for image and coordinate representations, respectively
- In Figure 4, we provide results for 4 other baselines to show the impact of the transformer and image representation over reasonable alternatives e.g., a fully connected MLP with coordinate input, a CNN with our image input, the transformer with a naive single-channel binary image input, and the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) (Li et al., 2020) developed to solve other PDEs such as Navier-Stokes with image input
- In the last row we reproduce the results of the 8-layer transformer with image input from Figure 3
- The 8 layer transformer is a 40%+ improvement on these baselines

### Optimization

- In this section, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed model by showing it can be used by an optimization procedure to find antenna configurations that have specific resonance characteristics

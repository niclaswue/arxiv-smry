# Abstract
- The effective brain connectome (EBC) is important for understanding information processing in the brain.
- A comprehensive mapping of the human EBC has not been achieved.
- A data-driven computational framework called Neural Perturbational Inference (NPI) is used to derive the human EBC.
- The NPI-inferred human EBC reveals log-normally distributed strengths of both excitatory and inhibitory connections.
- The EBC sheds light on the structure-function relationship in the brain and offers theoretical guidance for personalized neurostimulation.

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Brain is a complex network of interconnected regions
- Regions process information from environment and body
- Information is hierarchically transmitted among regions
- Structural connectivity (SC) maps physical connections between brain regions
- Functional connectivity (FC) examines statistical associations between regional neural signals
- SC provides static structural basis for functional interactions
- FC lacks directionality and cannot distinguish between directed and indirect interactions
- Effective connectivity (EC) describes how a particular brain region affects its downstream brain regions
- EC depends on SC and nonlinear brain dynamics
- Effective brain connectome (EBC) needed to understand information processing pathway
- Neurostimulation-based methods used to study EC
- Model-based and model-free approaches used to infer EC from neural signals
- Data-driven methods, particularly deep learning, used to fit and predict brain dynamics
- Neural Perturbational Inference (NPI) used to noninvasively infer EBC from fMRI data
- Inferred EBC exhibits desired properties: direction, strength, excitatory-inhibitory distinction

## Results

### Overview of npi framework
- NPI is a framework that infers EBC from neural signals
- Experimental methods such as DBS and TMS have been used to study EC in the brain
- NPI uses a data-driven approach to infer EC
- NPI uses an ANN as a surrogate brain to replace the real brain
- Perturbing each node in ANN offers the EBC which has strength, direction, and excitatory-inhibitory distinction

### Npi-inferred ec reflects sc underlying synthetic data
- EC is constrained by SC
- SC describes physical wiring of brain
- EC measures functional influence between regions
- EC is modulated by other factors
- NPI used to infer EC from BOLD signals
- NPI compared to GC and DCM
- NPI had significantly higher AUC than GC and DCM
- Nonlinear neural mass model used to assess performance of NPI
- Ground-truth SC is directed and sampled from Gaussian distribution
- Network is fully connected with ground-truth SC as weighted connections
- Each node modeled as Wilson-Cowan oscillator
- Neural firing rates transformed into BOLD signals using HRF
- EC inferred by applying NPI to BOLD time series
- Pearson's correlation coefficient used to measure performance
- NPI demonstrated significantly better performance than GC and DCM
- NPI performance remains robust as number of nodes increases
- Example of inference result for network with 50 regions shows strong correlation between ground-truth SC and inferred EC

### Ann model predicts the human brain dynamics and characterizes the functional connectome
- Applied NPI to rsfMRI data from 800 subjects
- Brain parcellated using MMP atlas
- ANN model trained separately for each subject
- Predicted signals accurately reflected true neural signals
- Predicted signals used to compare functional connectivity of generated and empirical BOLD data
- ANN model accurately captures topography of resting-state functional networks

### The human ebc inferred by npi
- Applied perturbations to ANN to measure response and infer EC
- Excitatory EC has higher density for ipsi-lateral connections, inhibitory EC has higher density for contra-lateral connections
- Degree of regions in binarized EBC calculated as mean of indegree and outdegree
- Indegree and outdegree are strongly correlated
- Distribution of connection strengths best fit by log-normal distribution
- Most connections in binarized EBC are bidirectional

### The relationship of structural, functional and effective connectome of human brain
- EC is strongly correlated with both SC and FC
- SC and EC have a modular structure
- EC better explains SC than FC
- FC distinguishes positive and negative correlations
- Entries with strong EC tend to have strong FC
- IS is a better predictor of FC than OS and EC itself

### Ebc uncovers information flow within and across large-scale brain networks
- Excitatory and inhibitory EC differ in distribution patterns
- Excitatory EC is more dense than inhibitory EC
- Excitatory EC is higher within functional networks, inhibitory EC is higher between them
- Seed-based EBC reveals network structure and how seed region inhibits other regions
- Strongest 15% of excitatory and inhibitory connections among networks reveal how they connect
- Excitatory EC follows information pathways, inhibitory EC concentrated in FPN and DMN

### The information flow within and across dmn
- DMN is a brain network active during rest or spontaneous thought
- Involved in cognitive functions such as memory consolidation, social cognition, and information integration
- Mechanisms of DMN's functions not fully understood
- Analyzed effective connectivity within and between DMN and other brain regions
- mPFC has weak inhibitory connections with other DMN regions
- Outflow and inflow of information across DMN regions depicted by EBC

## Discussion
- Shift in understanding of brain from localized regions to distributed network
- Proposed data-driven framework to infer EBC with direction, strength, and distinction between excitatory and inhibitory connections
- Applied framework to resting-state human fMRI data to uncover macroscopic organization of excitatory and inhibitory connections

### Npi is a general data-driven framework to infer causal relationship
- Perturbation is used to uncover causal relationships in complex systems
- NPI framework uses an ANN as a surrogate brain to be perturbed
- ANN was trained through one-step-ahead prediction
- Prediction performance of ANN was high (r2 = 0.988)
- ANN has good generalization ability
- Limitation of NPI is need for long time series to train ANN

### The relationship between structural, functional, and effective brain connectome
- Central question in neuroscience is how static brain structure supports rich brain functionality
- SC typically obtained through brain imaging techniques, but does not capture directionality or excitatory/inhibitory nature of connections
- FC usually calculates correlation among neural signals, but does not describe information flow in the brain
- NPI proposed to infer EBC, which offers directed EC among brain regions
- EC is a composite effect that depends on SC, nonlinear brain dynamics, regional heterogeneity, and spatiotemporal scale of observation
- EBC strongly correlated with whole-brain SC
- FC is result of both similar EC inputs and direct EC
- EC better explains SC than FC
- Future research to investigate how SC and macroscopic brain dynamics interact to support EC

### Insights from the human resting-state ebc
- Macroscopic information flow is important for connecting sensory inputs to cognitive functions
- NPI can be used to infer resting-state EBC from resting-state fMRI data
- Strength of connections in EBC follows a log-normal distribution
- NPI can distinguish between excitatory and inhibitory connections in EBC
- Excitatory connections are concentrated in local communities, while inhibitory connections have higher density across networks and hemispheres
- mPFC has inhibitory connections to other DMN regions and excitatory connections to hippocampus and cortex

### Future applications of npi framework
- NPI is a versatile framework that can be used to study causal relationships in various contexts.
- NPI can be used to analyze data from multiple spatiotemporal scales.
- NPI can be extended to other types of data, such as traffic flow and social network data.
- NPI can aid in the selection of control nodes for personalized neurostimulation.

## Methods

### The npi framework

- ECs had strength of 0 or 1
- 9 EC structures and 10 simulations with different noise were used
- Generative process of dataset follows linear equation
- Neural signals transformed into BOLD signals with Balloon-Windkessel hemodynamic model
- Binarized ECs compared to two baseline methods (GC and spDCM)
- Classification accuracy and AUC compared with varying thresholds

### Nonlinear generative model
- Nonlinear generative model is based on Wilson-Cowan model
- Model includes excitatory and inhibitory neural populations with varying number of nodes
- Long-range connections only exist among excitatory populations

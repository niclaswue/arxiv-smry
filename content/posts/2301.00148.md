# Abstract
- Effective brain connectome is of fundamental importance for understanding information processing in the brain
- To date, a comprehensive mapping of the human EBC has not been achieved
- Here we report a human EBC inferred through a data-driven computational framework called Neural Perturbational Inference (NPI)
- Specifically, we derive the human EBC by perturbing each region of a surrogate brain, an artificial neural network model trained to replicate the large-scale neural dynamics of the human brain, and observing the perturbation-induced changes in activity in other brain regions
- The NPI-inferred human EBC reveals log-normally distributed strengths of both excitatory and inhibitory connections and illuminates the large-scale organization of information flow within and across functional networks

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- The brain is a complex network of interconnected regions that are responsible for integrating and processing information from the environment and the body
- Information is constantly hierarchically transmitted among these regions, from primary regions that process sensory inputs to higher-level association regions involved in advanced cognitive processes such as learning and memory
- Characterizing the organization of whole-brain information flow is essential for understanding how the brain mediates the connection between stimuli and responses
- Existing measures of macroscopic inter-region interactions in the brain include structural connectivity (SC), which maps the physical connections between brain regions, and functional connectivity (FC), which examines statistical associations between regional neural signals
- SC provides a static structural basis for functional interactions, but it does not account for the dynamic nature of brain functionality
- FC examines the functional interactions but lacks directionality and cannot distinguish between directed and indirect interactions caused by confounding factors
- To move beyond correlation and towards a causal understanding of inter-region interactions, a directed connectivity measure called effective connectivity (EC) is necessary
- EC describes how a particular brain region positively or negatively affects its downstream brain regions and reveals the path of information processing in the brain
- EC depends on not only SC but also the modulation from nonlinear brain dynamics, which enables constantly changing information flow in the brain
- To fully understand the macroscopic information processing pathway, a whole-brain EC with strength, direction, and excitatory-inhibitory distinction, which we call the effective brain connectome (EBC), is required
- Neurostimulation-based methods have been employed to study effective connectivity, grounded in the principle of inferring causality by intervention experiments
- These methods include invasive techniques such as deep brain stimulation (DBS)
- However, it is challenging for current techniques to concurrently stimulate and observe stimulation-induced responses in the whole brain, which is necessary to obtain EBC
- As a result, many recent works focus on inferring EC non-invasively from neural signals
- Several computational tools have been developed to infer EC among brain regions from brain imaging and electrophysiological recordings
- These tools can be divided into model-based and model-free approaches
- The model-based approaches typically parameterize EC in a generative model and then estimate EC by fitting the model to neural signals
- For example, dynamic causal modeling (DCM) uses a biophysical model with EC as a parameter in neural dynamics, followed by a hemodynamic kernel to transform the neural signals into blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which is fitted to fMRI data
- While DCM has been widely used to estimate EC among a few regions, it is not suitable for studying EBC due to its high computational complexity in parameter estimation
- Another limitation of the model-based methods is their dependence on model assumptions, which may lead to a large inference bias if there is a mismatch between the model and the actual brain dynamics
- Modelfree approaches, on the other hand, do not depend on explicit assumptions about the underlying neural dynamics
- Instead, they use statistical methods to infer effective connectivity from observed neural signals
- For example, Granger Causality (GC) uses time series analysis to determine the extent to which past neural activity in one region can predict future neural activity in another region
- GC infers the strength and direction of EC but fails to distinguish between excitatory and inhibitory connections
- Additionally, the effectiveness of GC is debated due to both conceptual and performance limitations
- As a result, all existing model-based and model-free approaches have limited capacity at the macroscopic level due to high computational complexity and flawed model designs
- Computational tools for inferring human EBC from whole-brain imaging data are still lacking
- The human EBC remains unclear
- With the boosting of big data in neuroscience, there has been a growing trend towards data-driven methods, particularly deep learning, for fitting and predicting brain dynamics using artificial neural networks (ANNs)
- However, extracting the underlying EC from an ANN remains challenging due to the black-box and nonlinear nature of these networks
- In this study, we incorporate perturbation...

## Results

### Overview of NPI framework
- NPI is a framework that infers EBC from neural signals
- From brain imaging or electrophysiological recordings, the collective neural activities of multiple brain regions are available, but how these regions interact to process information remains unclear
- NPI aims to infer EC among these regions, which are directed and causal connections.
- Experimental methods such as DBS [10] and TMS [11] have been used to study EC in the brain by perturbing a source region and measuring the response in a target region [12]
- After perturbation, the magnitude of perturbation-induced response at the target region indicates the strength of EC between the two regions, which represents the causal influence of the source region on the target region.
- However, these techniques cannot offer EBC in humans due to their invasiveness and difficulty in simultaneously stimulating and measuring the response across the entire brain.
- To avoid physically perturbing the real brain, NPI uses a data-driven approach to infer EC
- Conceptually, NPI is similar to perturbing the real brain through neurostimulation, but it uses an ANN as a surrogate brain to replace the real brain, which enables efficient whole-brain perturbation and observation
- The ANN is trained to predict the next brain state based on the current brain by minimizing the one-step-ahead prediction error (see details in Method)
- After training, the ANN is treated as a surrogate brain. It is systematically perturbed to extract the underlying EC
- By perturbing a source region and observing the responses of target regions at the next time step, the EC is inferred based on the change in predicted neural activity compared to the predicted activity without perturbation
- An increase in activity indicates an excitatory connection, while a decrease in activity indicates an inhibitory connection.
- To account for statedependent responses to perturbation, which vary based on the initial state, the averaged response after perturbing under multiple different initial states is used as EC.
- Systematically perturbing each node in ANN offers the EBC
- EBC has both important scientific and technical significance.

### NPI-inferred EC reflects SC underlying synthetic data
- EC is a state-dependent measure of the functional influence among regions
- EC is constrained by SC, which describes the short-time static physical wiring diagram of the brain
- EC should reflect the structure of underlying SC
- NPI is a widely used EC inference algorithm that is better than two baseline methods, GC and DCM

### ANN model predicts the human brain dynamics and characterizes the functional connectome
- The ANN in NPI accurately reproduces brain dynamics
- The ANN model was trained separately for each subject using all four sessions of rsfMRI data
- The data from each session was divided into numerous input-output pairs, where the input was the signal at a particular time point and the output was the signal at the next time point
- The training pairs from all four sessions were combined, and 5% of these pairs were extracted as the testing set for that specific subject
- To assess the generalizability of the ANN, we evaluated its ability to perform one-step prediction using BOLD signals
- Given the BOLD signal at a particular time step, the ANN predicts the signal at the next time step
- The results demonstrated that the predicted signals accurately reflected the true neural signals, as indicated by values of the coefficient of determination (r 2 ) that were close to 1 for both the training signals (0.991) and the testing signals (0.988)

### The human EBC inferred by NPI
- ANN is effective in predicting neurodynamics
- Perturbations to ANN can be used to measure the perturbation-induced response
- EC is higher for ipsi-lateral connections, while the density of inhibitory EC is higher for contra-lateral connections
- The degree distribution of regions in the binarized EBC is best fitted by a normal distribution
- The indegree and outdegree of regions are strongly correlated (r = 0.43, p ≤ 10 −4 )

### The relationship of structural, functional and effective connectome of human brain
- EC is strongly correlated with both SC and FC
- EC better explains SC than FC
- FC is determined by both direct connections and shared inputs

### EBC uncovers information flow within and across large-scale brain networks
- The distribution of excitatory and inhibitory EC differ significantly.
- The overall density of excitatory EC is significantly higher than that of inhibitory EC.
- The density of excitatory EC is higher within functional networks than between them, with the highest density observed in the SOM.
- In contrast, the density of inhibitory EC is higher between functional networks than within them, with the highest density observed in the DMN.

### The information flow within and across DMN
- DMN is generally more active during rest or spontaneous thought than during task performance.
- The DMN is thought to be involved in a range of cognitive functions, such as memory consolidation, social cognition, and the integration of information from different brain regions.
- However, the mechanisms by which the DMN performs these functions, particularly in terms of macroscopic information integration, are still not fully understood.
- In order to better understand the role of the default mode network (DMN) in brain function, we analyzed the effective connectivity (EC) within the DMN and between the DMN and other cortical and subcortical regions.
- We focused on the four core regions of the DMN: the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), left inferior parietal cortex (LIPC), right inferior parietal cortex (RIPC), and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) (Fig. 7 a).
- Since the MMP atlas does not contain all the core DMN regions, we extract the BOLD signals in four DMN regions according to the MSDL parcellation.
- The EC within the core DMN, as inferred by the NPI, is shown in Fig. 7 b.
- The results show that the mPFC has weak inhibitory connections with the other three regions, and the connection strengths have low subject variability, which suggests a stable inhibitory role of mPFC within the DMN.
- In contrast, the connections between the LIPC and RIPC have the highest strength and are more variable.
- We then observed the DMN's outflow to the cortex and its inflow from the cortex, finding that although there were overlaps between the two, they were not identical (Fig. 6 e,f).
- Notably, the mPFC had inhibitory connections to DMN regions but wide excitatory connections to cortical regions. Additionally, a strong asymmetry in effective connectivity from the hippocampus to the mPFC was observed (Fig. A14), supporting the role of the mPFC in transmitting information from the hippocampus to other parts of the cortex, which has been linked to memory consolidation and consciousness formation [29,30].
- The inflow (d) and outflow (e) of information across the core DMN regions are depicted through the columns and rows of the EBC, respectively.

## Discussion
- The brain is now understood to be a distributed network of modules that integrate stimuli and generate responses
- To understand how the brain integrates received stimuli, characterizing EBC is necessary
- In this study, a data-driven framework called NPI was proposed to infer EBC
- The resting-state EBC was obtained and uncovers the macroscopic organization of excitatory and inhibitory connections within and across functional networks

### NPI is a general data-driven framework to infer causal relationship
- Perturbation has been widely used to uncover the causal relationship in complex systems across various domains, including the identification of gene regulatory networks through gene knockouts and the investigation of neuronal networks through optogenetics
- The perturbation-induced responses of distant regions have been used to infer causal relationships between the source region and the remote region
- However, directly and precisely perturbing specific regions of the human brain is often not possible due to technical and ethical considerations
- The NPI framework offers a solution by using an ANN as a surrogate brain to be perturbed, allowing for efficient whole-brain perturbation and stimulation without the difficulties of conducting experiments on actual brain tissue
- The performance of the ANN in predicting the neural response after applying perturbations is critical for an accurate EC inference
- In this study, the ANN was trained through one-step-ahead prediction, meaning it learned to predict the neural signals at the next time step given the current neural signals
- The learned ANN was then used to predict the neural response to perturbation by replacing the input signal with a signal after perturbation and obtaining the resulting neural response
- Like the testing data, the perturbed signal is also a small deviation from points in the training data. Therefore, the high prediction performance (r 2 = 0.988) in the testing data suggests the ANN would also perform well in predicting the response to perturbation and thus can serve as a surrogate for the brain to be perturbed
- The near-perfect prediction performance indicates the possibility of overfitting in the ANN, which means a model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen testing data
- However, the great prediction performance proves its good generalization ability
- The main limitations of NPI are the need for a relatively long time series to train the neural network (Fig. A3 d) and the need for a large number of data points to be used for training the ANN

### The relationship between structural, functional, and effective brain connectome
- SC does not capture the directionality of connections nor distinguish the excitatory or inhibitory nature of the connection
- FC, on the other side, usually calculates the correlation among neural signals
- However, FC does not describe information flow in the brain, since correlation is affected by input signals from other nearby regions and does not reflect the directionality of connections
- Therefore, we propose NPI and infer EBC
- EBC offers directed EC among brain regions.
- Although the concept of EC is widely used in neuroscience literature, the definition of EC is ambiguous and varies across different methods
- In this study, we define EC as the magnitude of the neural response induced by a perturbation to a specific brain region.
- This definition aligns with the statistical definition of causality: X has a causal effect on Y if an externally applied perturbation of X can result in a significant change in Y
- NPI-inferred EC represents how one brain region influences another.
- It is a compositive effect that depends on not only SC but also nonlinear brain dynamics, as well as regional heterogeneity.
- After a perturbation, the response to the perturbation is expected to propagate along physical connections (SC).
- However, the magnitude of the propagated response is modulated by nonlinear brain dynamics and the current state of the source and target regions. Additionally, EC is dependent on the specific temporal and spatial scale of the observation.
- On a large spatial scale, since there may be both excitatory and inhibitory SC between two regions, the EC between them is the composite effect after the cancellation of excitatory and inhibitory influences.
- On a large temporal scale, the EC between two regions can be the result of indirect SC between them that transmit information at a finer timescale.
- Therefore, EC should be considered at a specific spatiotemporal scale as it changes with the scales of observation.
- In NPI, ANN learns brain dynamics from neural signals.
- The EC obtained by perturbing ANN is thus the EC at the spatiotemporal scale that the neural signal is sampled.
- In this study, we inferred EC from BOLD signals.
- This EC is an integrative effect at a large spatiotemporal scale which integrates the underlying SC, excitatory-inhibitory balance, neural dynamics, and hemodynamics.
- The obtained EBC is strongly correlated with whole-brain SC, suggesting the shared network topology in brain structure and function.

### Insights from the human resting-state EBC
- Macroscopic information flow plays a crucial role in mediating the connection between sensory inputs and various cognitive functions, including attention, memory, and behaviors
- Multimodal feedforward and feedback information flow and higher-level information integration occur in parallel
- To understand the organization of parallel information flow in the brain, NPI can be used to infer resting-state EBC with strength, direction, and excitatory-inhibitory distinction from resting-state fMRI data
- The strength of connections in EBC follows a log-normal distribution for both excitatory and inhibitory connections, consistent with the distribution of SC in many species
- This is reasonable as EC is constrained by SC
- The log-normal distribution indicates that most connections are weak, with only a few being strong
- This distribution is thought to result from a tradeoff between minimizing wiring costs and energy consumption, while still maintaining efficient inter-regional communication
- One of the main advantages of NPI is the ability to distinguish between excitatory and inhibitory connections in the EBC
- Results showed that the majority of connections in the EBC were excitatory and that excitatory connections had a larger maximum strength and average density compared to inhibitory connections. Additionally, the distribution of excitatory and inhibitory connections varies, with excitatory connections being concentrated in local communities such as within functional networks and within a hemisphere, while inhibitory connections had a higher density across networks and across hemispheres
- The density of connections within and across functional networks also varies, where excitatory connections having a higher density in within unimodal networks such as the visual and somatomotor networks, and inhibitory connections having a higher density within transmodal networks, particularly within the frontoparietal and default mode networks. Moreover, the sequence of the mean density of excitatory connections in each functional network (Fig. A13) is similar to the large-scale cortical gradient from unimodal networks that process information from a signal modality such as visual and motor network to transmodal networks that integrate information from various sources such as the DMN
- It may suggest that unimodal networks require extensive excitatory connections to recurrently process primary information within the networks. Transmodal networks, on the contrary, need inhibitory connections to modulate and integrates information across various networks
- We then focus to the DMN, which is located at the end of the cortical gradient and is known to process transmodal information that is unrelated to immediate sensory inputs
- The flow of information within and between the DMN and other networks remains unclear
- Our results showed that the EC within the core DMN regions is similar to previous findings based on DCM

### Future applications of NPI framework
- NPI is a versatile framework that can be used to study the causal relationships in various contexts
- By applying NPI to the neural signals of patients with neurological diseases, it may be possible to identify network reorganizations in EBC and provide mechanical biomarkers
- Additionally, NPI can be used to analyze data from multiple spatiotemporal scales, including microscopic neuronal dynamics and mesoscopic neural population dynamics, which may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the brain
- NPI can also be extended to other types of data, such as traffic flow and social network data that can be represented as time series
- As neural stimulation is transmitted along the information flow, the NPI can also aid in the selection of control nodes for personalized neurostimulation

## Methods

### The NPI framework
- The NPI framework consists of two steps: i) training an ANN to predict the whole-brain neural dynamics as a surrogate brain, and ii) applying perturbations to each input node of the trained ANN as virtual neurostimulation to brain regions.
- First, an ANN f (•) is applied to model the cortical-level neural dynamics, where θ is the vector of all unknown parameters in the ANN model. x t is the vectorized fMRI data across the cortical areas at time step t, and xt+1 is the predicted fMRI data at time step t + 1 by the ANN model.
- Notably, the ANN can be realized with a variety of network architectures as long as it has sufficient expressive power to fit the whole-brain neural dynamics. In this study, we use a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture to realize the ANN model.
- The number of units in the first layer and the last layer of ANN is set to the number of brain regions. The number of units in hidden layers can vary with the complexity of the neural data applied for inferring EC. In this study, a five-layer MLP with the number of units 379, 800, 1000, 1000, 800, 379, and ReLU activation function is used.
- The ANN model is trained by minimizing the one-step-ahead prediction error (i.e., predicting the BOLD signal at the next time step given the signal at the current time step).
- The fMRI data are organized as pairs of two consecutive time points, x t and x t+1 . The objective function L(θ) can be explicitly formulated as: L(θ) = f (x t , θ) − x t+1 .
- The Adam optimizer is used to learn the network parameter θ. Once the ANN is trained, we perform virtual perturbations to each input node of ANN to infer the EC of brain regions.
- The perturbation is implemented as a selective increase of the BOLD signal at one specific region. By observing the induced response at all other regions, the one-to-all EC is inferred.
- The EC from the region A to the region B can thus be expressed as: where ∆ is the strength of perturbation that we applied to the region A. In this study, we set ∆ as half of the standard deviation of the BOLD activity.
- We also test different perturbation strengths and find the inference performance is robust to the perturbation strength.

### Linear generative model
- To evaluate the performance of NPI, we applied NPI using simulated BOLD signals where ground-truth ECs are available.
- First, we show the performance of NPI on a dataset generated by Sanchez-Romero et al. [21]. The ground-truth ECs are directional graphs with 5 to 10 nodes. The strength of ECs is either 0 or 1. Nine EC structures with different degree of complexity and ten simulations with different noise for each structure are used.
- The generative process of this dataset follows the linear equation: where dx/dt describes the temporal evolution of neural signals; σ is a constant that controls the within and between nodes neural lag, as described by Smith et al. [50]; A is the directed EC matrix that describes the directed interaction among nodes; and B is the coefficient matrix describes how external inputs u affect the neural dynamics.
- To simulate the resting-state data where neural dynamics are not affected by structured external inputs, u is set to be a Poisson process for each region.
- Finally, the neural signals are transformed into BOLD signals through the nonlinear Balloon-Windkessel hemodynamic model where time repeat (TR) is set to 3 s.
- For the binarized EC, we also binarized the inferred EC and compared the performance of NPI with two baseline methods for classifying the existence of edges between every pair of nodes. The baseline methods used are Granger Causality (GC) [15] and spectral Dynamic Causal Modelling (spDCM) [14].
- The GC is implemented using the MVGC toolbox [15] and DCM is implemented using the SPM12 toolbox [51].
- We compare the classification accuracy using 0.5 as the threshold to binarize the ECs and compare the area under ROC curve (AUC) with varying thresholds.

### Nonlinear generative model
- Nonlinear generative model is based on the Wilson-Cowan model
- The local dynamics are described by the interaction between an excitatory and an inhibitory neural population
- To simplify the model, we assume the long-range connections only exist among the excitatory populations
- The strength of ECs is sampled from the standard Gaussian distribution
- The dynamics of neural signals follows: where ∂x i (t)/∂t and ∂y i (t)/∂t describe the temporal evolution of two populations in a brain region; I x and I y are the external inputs to X and Y population; w XX , w XY , w Y X , and w Y Y are the parameters controlling the connection strength from X to X, from X to Y , from Y to X, and from Y to Y ; C is the ground-truth EC; and v i is the noise applied to the X population
- We assume the observed signals are from the X populations
- The neural signal X i is transformed to the BOLD signal through the Balloon-Windkessel hemodynamic kernel function where TR is set to 1 s
- For nonlinear generative models, we compare the Pearson's correlation coefficient between NPI estimated EC and ground-truth EC with baseline models

### Hemodynamic equations
- The neural signals from both linear and nonlinear models are transformed to BOLD signals
- The hemodynamics can be written as the following equations:
- Given q i and v i , the BOLD signal is as follows:
- Values for fixed parameters are taken from previous studies and are provided in the Supplementary File

### Validation of NPI with synthetic data
- The linear generative model produces binary ground-truth connections, while the nonlinear generative model produces continuously weighted connections.
- The linear generative model has a lower classification accuracy than the nonlinear generative model when using a 0.5 threshold, but the AUC is higher.
- When using a 10-dimensional network, NPI outperforms GC, while when using a 300-dimensional network, DCM outperforms both GC and NPI.

### Empirical data and the brain atlas
- The Human Connectome Project (HCP) released S1200 which includes restingstate fMRI data from 800 subjects
- The preprocessing of fMRI is based on the multi-modal inter-subject registration (MSMAII)
- rsfMRI data is recorded with TR 0.72s
- Each subject comprises two sessions on separate days and each day contains two runs of 15-min rsfMRI, resulting in four runs in total
- Every consecutive time points are organized as input-output pairs. The pairs for four runs are mixed to train the model.
- When testing prediction performance, the testing set comprises 100 randomly sampled pairs in all shuffled input-output pairs and the rest data are used to train the model.
- The brain is parcellated into 360 cortical regions according to the Multi-Modal Parcellation (MMP 1.0) atlas
- The parcellation is done by averaging the fMRI of each voxel in each region.

### Construction of the whole-brain SC, FC and EC
- The resting-state fMRI time series is preprocessed according to the HCP minimal preprocessing pipeline
- The denoising process is performed using ICA-FIX which cleans the structured noise by a process combining independent component analysis and the FSL tool FIX
- The denoised data are further processed using the Python package nilearn that extracts the data at 0.1 to 0.01 Hz
- FC is calculated as Pearson's correlation coefficient between the time series of each pair of brain regions
- The FC of one subject is obtained by averaging the FC of four runs
- The structural connectivity constructed by Demirtaş et al. is used
- It is derived using FSL's bedpostx and probtrackx2 analysis workflows that count the number of streamlines intersecting the white matter and gray matter
- The SC matrix was scaled between 0 and 1
- The EC for each subject is obtained from the NPI framework that was trained using the four runs of fMRI of each subject
- It is then averaged across 800 subjects and scaled as the strongest connection has strength one

### Parcellation of functional networks
- The parcellated 360 cortical regions are assigned to seven functional networks
- The seven functional networks are the visual network (VIS), the somatomotor network (SOM), the dorsal attention network (DAN), the ventral attention network (VAN), the frontoparietal control network (FPN), and the default mode network (DMN)
- Each region is assigned to the functional network with the largest number of voxels to that region belongs
- We place the seed in the left-hemisphere core brain region of each of the seven functional networks (seeds are shown in Table A1)
- Then we calculate the seed-based FC using Pearson's correlation between the seed region and the rest regions
- Due to the low SNR of the limbic network, we excluded it from the seed-based plots

### EC between DMN and other cortical and subcortical regions
- The EC can be inferred by perturbing a specific source brain region using neurostimulation and observing the perturbation-induced response in target regions.
- To infer EBC without invasive perturbation to the brain, we present a data-driven framework called NPI.
- After training, ANN is systematically perturbed to offer EC.
- The all-to-all EC, which is EBC, can be inferred by perturbing the ANN node by node.
- In the nonlinear neural mass model, the ground-truth SC is directed and sampled from a Gaussian distribution.
- The network is fully connected, with ground truth SC serving as weighted connections among excitatory nodes.
- Each node (brain region) in the network (for example, node i) is modeled as a Wilson-Cowan oscillator, which consists of an excitatory node E i and an inhibitory node I i .
- The neural firing rates of the excitatory nodes are observed and transformed into BOLD signals using an HRF.
- The EC is inferred by applying NPI to the generated BOLD signals.
- The Pearson's correlation coefficient between ground-truth SC (g) and the inferred EC (k) is calculated in the nonlinear case since the elements in the EC matrix are continuous rather than binary.
- When applied to networks with 10 nodes, our NPI method demonstrated significantly better performance than the GC (p ≤ 10 −4 ) and DCM (p ≤ 10 −4 ) methods.
- As the number of nodes in the network increases, the performance of the NPI remains robust, while the performance of the GC declines significantly.

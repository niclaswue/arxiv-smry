# Abstract
- GWAS tests SNP markers to identify causal variants of a trait.
- Establishing a connection between the surrogate model and the true causal model.
- Population structure is accounted for in GWAS by modelling the variant of interest and not the trait.
- Environmental confounding can be partially corrected using genetic covariates.

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- GWAS identifies regions in the genome responsible for variation in a trait
- SNPs are tested for association with the trait
- SNPs are dense and widespread across the genome
- GWAS uses a marker-additive model (MAM) to estimate parameters
- MAM parameters have no direct causal interpretation
- This work considers a causal-additive model (CAM) with direct causal interpretation

## Setup
- Population membership is described by C i and M i which take values 0, 1, 2
- Marker-additive model (MAM) includes marker effect size β and noise variable δ
- Marginal testing is used, where M i1 is the marker being tested
- Leave one chromosome out (LOCO) approach removes markers close to the variant being tested
- Causal-additive model (CAM) includes causal effect size α and noise variable ǫ
- Pritchard-Stephens-Donnelly (PSD) model describes population structure incorporating admixture
- Random mating is assumed, with haplotype frequencies and linkage disequilibrium (LD) parameters
- Linear projection of X respect to Y is used
- Genotype at different haplotypes are conditionally independent
- Goal is to characterize the estimand of the regression under the CAM
- Estimand β 1 (S i ) is a weighted average over β 1 (S i )

## Main results
- GWAS is interested in the contribution of linkage with a physically proximal causal variant
- It is partially achievable to separate path (1) from path (2) under population-based design
- It is achievable under within-sibship design
- Population structure affects β 1,nocov in two ways: attenuates true signal and puts undesirable signals into estimand
- Weights of linkage term in Theorem 3.2 sum up to a value smaller than 1
- Prediction error becomes negligible with large number of markers as covariates

### Within-sibship gwas.
- Within-sibship GWAS observes family membership of each individual
- Regression (3.1) is equivalent to the famous sibling difference regression when there are only two siblings per family
- Estimand of regression (3.1) is equal to β 1,s, the population estimand when S is known
- Non-genetic confounding is partially resolved with genetic markers in linear regression

## Conclusions
- Aimed to solve the identification problem of GWAS of quantitative traits using linear regression in a structured population
- Established the connection between the CAM and the MAM which provides a closedform formula for what is being estimated using linear regression
- Population structure exhibits a two-fold effect in which it induces an additive confounding term together with an attenuation of the true effect of a causal variant
- Within-sibship design can overcome this problem due to direct access to family membership
- Bias is corrected by modelling the distribution of the variant and not the trait
- Bias is never completely removed because the expectation of the variant being tested is never truly linear respect to the covariate markers
- Genetic covariates can further correct environmental confounding
- Framework to be extended to incorporate other important evolutionary processes such as assortative mating and inbreeding
- Haplotype dependence induced by such evolutionary processes is likely to have an non-trivial impact on GWAS estimands
- Shortcoming of the work is that it only deals with the identification and tells little about the estimation process

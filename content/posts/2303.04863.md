# Abstract
- Recent research is exploring how cognitive processes are affected by the brain and body.
- Physiological features such as breathing rhythms, heart rate, and skin conductance are being analyzed.
- Heart rate dynamics are of particular interest as they provide insight into the autonomic nervous system.
- Extracting useful information from heartbeats is challenging due to noisy estimates.
- A new modelling framework views heart rate as a hidden stochastic process.

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Autonomic nervous system (ANS) is responsible for physiological adjustments and responding to environmental demands
- ANS is composed of afferent and efferent pathways involving multiple neural structures
- ANS is involved in cognitive processes such as attention, memory, decision-making, and emotional processing
- Measurement of autonomic outflow can provide insights into physiological substrates that support human cognition
- Popular approach to investigate autonomic outflow is by analysing properties of how heart rate changes over time
- Heart rate variability (HRV) is thought to reflect changes in sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of ANS
- Conventional metrics of HRV are based on spectral decomposition or other linear methods, unable to capture non-linear fluctuations
- Growing literature provides insights on HRV patterns by investigating fractality and signal complexity
- Need for more powerful and flexible estimation methods to better characterise richness of heart rate dynamics
- Proposed framework to model and estimate heart rate dynamics based on state-space modelling and Bayesian statistics

## Results

### A bayesian approach to model heart rate dynamics
- Heart rate is estimated by counting the number of beats over a period of time.
- A point estimate is used to calculate the average number of beats.
- An alternative approach uses a generative model to estimate the heart rate dynamics.
- The model involves two time series, one counting the number of heart beats and one representing the heart rate.
- The model uses a probability distribution to describe the likelihood of observing a given sequence of heart beats.
- The model estimates the most likely heart rate trajectory and also estimates uncertainty.

### Method validation
- Tested proposed method by analyzing autonomic outflow of healthy subjects
- Used public dataset of 10 healthy subjects
- Calculated inter-beat intervals via template-based matching of QRS waves
- Generated smoother and more plausible trajectories than frequentist approach
- Used computational modelling to assess consistency of estimated autonomic outflow
- Synthetic heart rate matches measured heart rate in supine and standing positions
- Values of mean heart rate significantly correlated among subjects

### Comparable discriminative power of spectral properties
- Generative modelling can be used to build Bayesian estimators of properties of heart rate dynamics
- Bayesian estimators weight the value of a property for each possible trajectory by the likelihood of the trajectory given the observed data
- For linear properties, the equation reduces to the average trajectory under the posterior
- Spectral properties of heart rate dynamics were studied using Bayesian estimators
- Two different values for hyperparameter θ were used: 0.01 and 1
- Mean heart rate effects were similar for all estimation approaches
- Model with θ = 0.01 had better performance distinguishing between different states than the model with θ = 1
- Discriminative power of the model with θ = 0.01 was comparable to the frequentist method

### Better performance for measures of dynamical complexity
- Analytic techniques inspired by complexity science can describe biological processes
- If a dynamical property of heart rate dynamics is non-linear, its expected value is different from the property evaluated on the average trajectory
- Bayesian estimators can assess this difference
- Hurst exponent and permutation entropy are two metrics of dynamical complexity
- Bayesian model with θ = 1 reveals strong effects in both metrics

## Discussion
- Introduces a new conceptual and modelling paradigm for autonomic processes
- Uses state-space modelling and Bayesian statistics
- Sampled trajectories can be used to estimate posterior distribution of heart rate dynamics
- Bayesian estimators of dynamical complexity have more discrimative power than frequentist approach
- Future work could model sympathetic and parasympathetic activities separately and model interactions between multiple physiological signals

## Materials and methods

### Overall modelling approach
- Model of heart rate dynamics based on two time series
- Time series correspond to values of dynamical processes
- Assume heart beats are observed, heart rate follows hidden stochastic process
- Joint probability distribution of heart rate and heart beats expressed as Markovian
- Model requires three ingredients: heart rate dynamics, link between heart rate and heart beats, and distribution of initial condition
- Dynamics of hidden process modeled by Gamma Markov Chain
- Link between heart rate and heart beats modeled by Poisson distribution
- Model parameters are α1, β1, and γ
- Maximum likelihood estimation used to choose α1 and β1
- Prior distribution used to choose γ
- Posterior distributions have simple expressions
- Samples of trajectories computed using Gibbs sampler
- Hyperparameters θ and τ used to control smoothness and connectivity strength
- Sampling frequency f s = 1 Hz

### Building bayesian estimators of properties of heart
- Leverage trajectory sampling technology to build Bayesian estimators of properties of heart rate dynamics
- Estimate various properties of heart rate dynamics as the empirical mean value of the posterior
- Suggest that the proposed model for heart rate dynamics is generally non-ergodic
- Run Gibbs sampler for Nr = 2 x 10^4 and discard the first Nd

### Ecg data and preprocessing
- Analyzed estimation of heart rate on data set of postural changes
- Data set comprised one-lead ECG series from 10 healthy subjects
- Subjects underwent tilt-table test
- Six sessions sorted randomly between resting periods
- ECG preprocessing involved frequency filtering, R-peak detection, and correction of misdetections
- Used IPFM model to generate synthetic series of heartbeat dynamics
- IPFM model considers combination of heart rate components of sympathetic-vagal control as inputs to an integrator
- GMC model used for Bayesian inference

### Code availability
- Code to run Bayesian estimation of heart rate dynamics can be found on github
- Observable data (heart beats) are driven by hidden stochastic process (heart rate)
- Figure 2 compares frequentist and Bayesian estimation of heart rate
- Figure 3 validates the method using synthetic heart rate series
- Figure 4 shows effects of physiological states on properties of heart rate dynamics
- Figure 5 is a graphical model representation of the proposed state-space model for heart rate dynamics

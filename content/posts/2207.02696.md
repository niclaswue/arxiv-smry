# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Real-time object detection is a very important topic in computer vision, as it is often a necessary component in computer vision systems.
- For example, multi-object tracking [94,93], autonomous driving [40,18], robotics [35,58], medical image analysis [34,46], etc.
- The computing devices that execute real-time object detection is usually some mobile CPU or GPU, as well as various neural processing units (NPU) developed by major manufacturers.
- For example, the Apple neural engine (Apple), the neural compute stick (Intel), Jetson AI edge devices (Nvidia), the edge TPU (Google), the neural processing engine (Qualcomm), the AI processing unit (MediaTek), and the AI SoCs (Kneron), are all NPUs.
- Some of the above mentioned edge devices focus on speeding up different operations such as vanilla convolution, depth-wise convolution, or MLP operations.
- In this paper, the real-time object detector we proposed mainly hopes that it can support both mobile GPU and GPU devices from the edge to the cloud.
- Recently, the real-time object detector is still developed for different edge device. For example, the devel- opment of MCUNet [49,48] and NanoDet [54] focused on producing low-power single-chip and improving the inference speed on edge CPU.
- As for methods such as YOLOX [21] and YOLOR [81], they focus on improving the inference speed of various GPUs.
- More recently, the development of real-time object detector has focused on the design of efficient architecture. As for real-time object detectors that can be used on CPU [54,88,84,83], their design is mostly based on MobileNet [28,66,27], ShuffleNet [92,55], or GhostNet [25].
- Another mainstream real-time object detectors are developed for GPU [81,21,97], they mostly use ResNet [26], DarkNet [63], or DLA [87], and then use the CSPNet [80] strategy to optimize the architecture.
- The development direction of the proposed methods in this paper are different from that of the current mainstream real-time object detectors.
- In addition to architecture optimization, our proposed methods will focus on the optimization of the training process. Our focus will be on some optimized modules and optimization methods which may strengthen the training cost for improving the accuracy of object detection, but without increasing the inference cost.
- We call the proposed modules and optimization methods trainable bag-of-freebies.
- Recently, model re-parameterization [13,12,29] and dynamic label assignment [20,17,42] have become important topics in network training and object detection.
- Mainly after the above new concepts are proposed, the training of object detector evolves many new issues.
- In this paper, we will present some of the new issues we have discovered and devise effective methods to address them.
- For model reparameterization, we analyze the model re-parameterization strategies applicable to layers in different networks with the concept of gradient propagation path, and propose planned re-parameterized model.
- When we discover that with dynamic label assignment technology, the training of model with multiple output layers will generate new issues. That is: "How to assign dynamic targets for the outputs of different branches?"
- For this problem, we propose a new label assignment method called coarse-to-fine lead guided label assignment.

### Model re-parameterization
- Model re-parameterization techniques merge multiple computational modules into one at inference stage.
- The model re-parameterization technique can be regarded as an ensemble technique, and we can divide it into two categories, i.e., module-level ensemble and model-level ensemble.
- There are two common practices for model-level reparameterization to obtain the final inference model. One is to train multiple identical models with different training data, and then average the weights of multiple trained models. The other is to perform a weighted average of the weights of models at different iteration number.
- Modulelevel re-parameterization is a more popular research issue recently. This type of method splits a module into multiple identical or different module branches during training and integrates multiple branched modules into a completely equivalent module during inference.
- However, not all proposed re-parameterized module can be perfectly applied to different architectures. With this in mind, we have developed new re-parameterization module and designed related application strategies for various architectures.

### Model scaling
- Model scaling is a way to scale up or down an already designed model
- Model scaling methods usually use different scaling factors, such as resolution (size of input image), depth (number of layer), width (number of channel), and stage (number of feature pyramid), so as to achieve a good trade-off for the amount of network parameters, computation, inference speed, and accuracy
- Network architecture search (NAS) is one of the commonly used model scaling methods
- NAS can automatically search for suitable scaling factors from search space without defining too complicated rules
- The disadvantage of NAS is that it requires very expensive computation to complete the search for model scaling factors

## Architecture

### Extended efficient layer aggregation networks
- The main considerations when designing an efficient architecture are the number of parameters, the amount of computation, and the computational density.
- Starting from the characteristics of memory access cost, Ma et al. [55] also analyzed the influence of the input/output channel ratio, the number of branches of the architecture, and the element-wise operation on the network inference speed.
- Doll√°r et al. [15] additionally considered activation when performing model scaling, that is, to put more consideration on the number of elements in the output tensors of convolutional layers.
- The design of CSPVoVNet [79] in Figure 2 (b) is a variation of VoVNet [39].
- In addition to considering the aforementioned basic designing concerns, the architecture of CSPVoVNet [79] also analyzes the gradient path, in order to enable the weights of different layers to learn more diverse features.
- ELAN [1] in Figure 2 (c) considers the following design strategy -"How to design an efficient network?."
- They came out with a conclusion: By controlling the shortest longest gradient path, a deeper network can learn and converge effectively.
- In this paper, we propose Extended-ELAN (E-ELAN) based on ELAN and its main architecture is shown in Figure 2 (d).
- Regardless of the gradient path length and the stacking number of computational blocks in large-scale ELAN, it has reached a stable state.
- If more computational blocks are stacked unlimitedly, this stable state may be destroyed, and the parameter utilization rate will decrease.
- The proposed E-ELAN uses expand, shuffle, merge cardinality to achieve the ability to continuously enhance the learning ability of the network without destroying the original gradient path.
- In terms of architecture, E-ELAN only changes the architecture in computational block, while the architecture of transition layer is completely unchanged.

### Model scaling for concatenation-based models
- model scaling is used to adjust some attributes of the model and generate models of different scales to meet the needs of different inference speeds
- for concatenation-based models, only the depth in a computational block needs to be scaled
- when scaling the depth factor of a computational block, we must also calculate the change of the output channel of that block
- then, we will perform width factor scaling with the same amount of change on the transition layers, and the result is shown in Figure 3 (c)

### Coarse for auxiliary and fine for lead loss
- Deep supervision is a technique that is often used in training deep networks
- Deep supervision can still significantly improve the performance of the model on many tasks
- In order to generate soft labels for auxiliary head and lead head, deep supervision needs to be trained on the target objectives regardless of the circumstances of auxiliary head or lead head
- The most popular method for label assignment in deep supervision is to separate auxiliary head and lead head, and then use their own prediction results and the ground truth to execute label assignment
- A new label assignment method that guides both auxiliary head and lead head by the lead head prediction is proposed in this paper.

### Other trainable bag-of-freebies
- In this section we will list some trainable bag-offreebies.
- These freebies are some of the tricks we used in training, but the original concepts were not proposed by us.
- The training details of these freebies will be elaborated in the Appendix, including (1) Batch normalization in conv-bn-activation topology: This part mainly connects batch normalization layer directly to convolutional layer. The purpose of this is to integrate the mean and variance of batch normalization into the bias and weight of convolutional layer at the inference stage. (2) Implicit knowledge in YOLOR [81] combined with convolution feature map in addition and multiplication manner: Implicit knowledge in YOLOR can be simplified to a vector by pre-computing at the inference stage. This vector can be combined with the bias and weight of the previous or subsequent convolutional layer. (3) EMA model: EMA is a technique used in mean teacher [75], and in our system we use EMA model purely as the final inference model.

## Experiments

### Experimental setup
- We use Microsoft COCO dataset to conduct experiments and validate our object detection method.
- All our experiments did not use pre-trained models. That is, all models were trained from scratch.
- During the development process, we used train 2017 set for training, and then used val 2017 set for verification and choosing hyperparameters.
- Finally, we show the performance of object detection on the test 2017 set and compare it with the state-of-the-art object detection algorithms.
- Detailed training parameter settings are described in Appendix.
- We designed basic model for edge GPU, normal GPU, and cloud GPU, and they are respectively called YOLOv7tiny, YOLOv7, and YOLOv7-W6.
- At the same time, we also use basic model for model scaling for different service requirements and get different types of models.
- For YOLOv7, we do stack scaling on neck, and use the proposed compound scaling method to perform scaling-up of the depth and width of the entire model, and use this to obtain YOLOv7-X.
- As for YOLOv7-W6, we use the newly proposed compound scaling method to obtain YOLOv7-E6 and YOLOv7-D6.
- In addition, we use the proposed E-ELAN for YOLOv7-E6, and thereby complete YOLOv7-E6E.
- Since YOLOv7-tiny is an edge GPU-oriented architecture, it will use leaky ReLU as activation function.
- As for other models we use SiLU as activation function.

### Baselines
- We choose previous version of YOLO [3,79] and state-of-the-art object detector YOLOR [81] as our baselines.
- Table 1 shows the comparison of our proposed YOLOv7 models and those baseline that are trained with the same settings.
- From the results we see that if compared with YOLOv4, YOLOv7 has 75% less parameters, 36% less computation, and brings 1.5% higher AP.
- If compared with state-of-the-art YOLOR-CSP, YOLOv7 has 43% fewer parameters, 15% less computation, and 0.4% higher AP.
- In the performance of tiny model, compared with YOLOv4-tiny-31, YOLOv7tiny reduces the number of parameters by 39% and the amount of computation by 49%, but maintains the same AP.
- On the cloud GPU model, our model can still have a higher AP while reducing the number of parameters by 19% and the amount of computation by 33%.

### Comparison with state-of-the-arts
- The proposed method has the best speed-accuracy trade-off comprehensively.
- If we compare YOLOv7-tiny-SiLU with YOLOv5-N (r6.1), our method is 127 fps faster and 10.7% more accurate on AP.
- In addition, YOLOv7 has 51.4% AP at frame rate of 161 fps, while PPYOLOE-L with the same AP has only 78 fps frame rate.
- In terms of parameter usage, YOLOv7 is 41% less than PPYOLOE-L.
- If we compare YOLOv7-X with 114 fps inference speed to YOLOv5-L (r6.1) with 99 fps inference speed, YOLOv7-X can improve AP by 3.9%.
- If YOLOv7-X is compared with YOLOv5-X (r6.1) of similar scale, the inference speed of YOLOv7-X is 31 fps faster.
- In addition, in terms of the amount of parameters and computation, YOLOv7-X reduces 22% of parameters and 8% of computation compared to YOLOv5-X (r6.1), but improves AP by 2.2%.
- If we compare YOLOv7 with YOLOR using the input resolution 1280, the inference speed of YOLOv7-W6 is 8 fps faster than that of YOLOR-P6, and the detection rate is also increased by 1% AP.
- As for the comparison between YOLOv7-E6 and YOLOv5-X6 (r6.1), the former has 0.9% AP gain than the latter, 45% less parameters and 63% less computation, and the inference speed is increased by 47%.
- YOLOv7-D6 has close inference speed to YOLOR-E6, but improves AP by 0.8%.
- YOLOv7-E6E has close inference speed to YOLOR-D6, but improves AP by 0.3%.
- Table 3 shows the results obtained when using different model scaling strategies for scaling up.
- Among them, our proposed compound scaling method is to scale up the depth of computational block by 1.5 times and the width of transition block by 1.25 times.
- If our method is compared with the method that only scaled up the width, our method can improve the AP by 0.5% with less parameters and amount of computation.
- If our method is compared with the method that only scales up the depth, our method only needs to increase the number of parameters by 2.9% and the amount of computation by 1.2%, which can improve the AP by 0.2%.
- It can be seen from the results of Table 3 that our proposed compound scaling strategy can utilize parameters and computation more efficiently.
- In the experiment of concatenation-based model, we replace the 3 √ó 3 convolutional layers in different positions in 3-stacked ELAN with RepConv, and the detailed configuration is shown in Figure 6.
- From the results shown in Table 4 we see that all higher AP values are present on our proposed planned re-parameterized model.
- In the experiment dealing with residual-based model, since the original dark block does not have a 3 √ó 3 con-

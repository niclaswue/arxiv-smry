# Abstract
- Clustering data lying close to a union of low-dimensional manifolds is a fundamental problem in machine learning
- When the manifolds are assumed to be linear subspaces, many methods succeed using
- However, most works either assume knowledge of the membership of samples to clusters, or are shown to learn trivial representations
- In this paper, we propose to simultaneously perform clustering and learn a union-of-subspace representation via Maximal Coding Rate Reduction
- Experiments on synthetic and realistic datasets show that the proposed method achieves clustering accuracy comparable with state-of-the-art alternatives, while being more scalable and learning geometrically meaningful representations.

# Paper Content

## Introduction 1.Motivation and Contributions

## We conduct experiments on simulation and CIFAR10
- to demonstrate some desirable properties of the proposed method.
- We further experiment on datasets with larger number of clusters and imbalanced clusters such as CIFAR100-20, CIFAR100-100, and Tiny-ImageNet200, and show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.
- Beyond the above, we make connections to a few important works that are related to this paper.

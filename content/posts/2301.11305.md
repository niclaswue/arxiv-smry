# Abstract
- LLMs can be used to complete written assignments, making it difficult for instructors to assess student learning.
- Text sampled from an LLM tends to occupy negative curvature regions of the model's log probability function.
- DetectGPT is a new curvature-based criterion for judging if a passage is generated from a given LLM.
- DetectGPT is more discriminative than existing zero-shot methods for model sample detection.

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- LLMs can generate fluent responses to user queries
- Examples of LLMs include GPT-3, PaLM, and ChatGPT
- LLM-generated responses can be wrong
- LLMs can be used to replace human labor in some contexts
- News sources have released AI-written content with limited human review, leading to factual errors
- Humans perform only slightly better than chance when classifying machine-generated vs human-written text
- Automated detection methods may identify signals difficult for humans to recognize
- DetectGPT is a zero-shot method for automated machine-generated text detection
- DetectGPT compares the log probability of a candidate passage with the average log probability of several perturbations
- DetectGPT is more accurate than existing zero-shot methods for detecting machine-generated text

- DetectGPT approximates a measure of the local curvature of the log probability function near the candidate passage
- DetectGPT is summarized in Alg. 1
- DetectGPT normalizes the perturbation discrepancy by the standard deviation of the observed values
- DetectGPT thresholds the perturbation discrepancy to detect if a piece of text was generated by a model

## Experiments
- Conduct experiments to understand machine-generated text detection
- Compare DetectGPT to prior zero-shot approaches
- Study impact of distribution shift on zero-shot and supervised detectors
- Analyze factors that impact detection accuracy

### Main results
- DetectGPT improves average detection accuracy for XSum stories and SQuAD Wikipedia contexts.
- Log-rank thresholding is a stronger baseline than log probability thresholding.
- Supervised detectors can provide similar detection performance to DetectGPT on in-distribution data like English news.
- DetectGPT is effective on a variety of domains and models.
- DetectGPT can provide detection competitive with the stronger supervised model.
- DetectGPT maintains detection AUROC above 0.8 even when nearly a quarter of the text in model samples has been replaced.
- Top-k and nucleus sampling make detection easier.
- Using a different model to score a candidate passage than the model that generated the passage reduces detection performance.
- There is a clear association between capacity of mask-filling model and detection performance.

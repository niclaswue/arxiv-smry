# Abstract
- Problem of inferring technological structure of production processes unsolved
- Empirical literature focuses on outputs instead of transformative processes
- Method developed to quantify technological sophistication
- Method measures degree of synergistic interaction between inputs
- Synergistic technologies more sophisticated
- Synergy scores predict export-based measures of economic complexity

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Transformative process of turning inputs into outputs is present in various systems
- Different disciplines analyze it through distinct frameworks and tools
- Technological sophistication is a building block in the study of economic complexity
- Quantifying degree and structure of technological sophistication is important to understand production systems
- Developed a method to quantify technological sophistication of production processes
- Method empirically infers nature of input-input and input-output relationships
- Method facilitates quantification of technological sophistication and estimation of interaction networks
- Method is of general purpose and can be adapted to other contexts

## Knowledge gap
- Technological change can be described as a recombinant process
- Evidence supports this process
- Technological sophistication is related to this process
- Empirical evidence is domain-specific
- Generating reliable estimates requires big data
- Production models assume input-input and input-output interactions
- Limitations of this approach have been discussed
- Supply-chain surveys have been conducted to determine dependence on inputs
- Systems engineering has developed the concept of Design Structure Matrices
- Data-driven approach needed to infer interaction structures
- Economic complexity literature has emerged
- Economic Fitness Index and Economic Complexity Index are gold standard
- These frameworks provide proxy for technological sophistication
- Production processes remain obscure
- Quantification of technological sophistication is a problem for multiple disciplines
- Need for generalizable quantitative methods to address production process

## Framework and data
- Estimate mutual information between pairs of inputs in a given industry
- Decompose contribution to output into different modes of information sharing
- Focus on synergistic information, i.e. information that can only be obtained from interaction between inputs
- Measure degree of synergy between inputs and estimate a synergy score
- Higher synergy score means more novel information during production process
- Synergy score quantifies technological sophistication

### The synergy score
- Data Y captures changes in output of industry
- Data X1 and X2 capture changes in inputs 1 and 2
- Total mutual information measures amount of uncertainty in Y reduced by knowing X1 and X2
- Partial information decomposition (PID) decomposes mutual information into synergistic type and other types
- Synergistic information can only be obtained from interaction between X1 and X2
- Synergy score is used to compute all unique pairs of inputs in data

### Data
- Dataset used to capture technological sophistication is Eora26, which contains input-output tables for 26 industries across 148 countries from 1995-2020
- Data is transformed into log-fluctuations (growth rates)
- Method tested using OECD IO tables, covering 66 countries across 45 unique industries
- Synergy scores tested to see if they contribute to prediction of economic complexity indices
- Economic complexity indices constructed using independent dataset on export flows

### Descriptive features
- Synergy networks capture the average technological structure of a group of countries
- Synergy networks show that the same industry can have different interaction structures in different countries
- Quantifying and understanding the internal structure of production processes is important for measuring technological sophistication
- Diversity of synergies is important for measuring technological sophistication
- Highly synergistic interactions are less abundant than low-synergy ones

## Results

### Predicting economic complexity
- Investigated relationship between synergy scores and complexity indices
- Found clear positive correlation between synergy score and three indices
- Synergistic interactions may predict proxies of economic sophistication
- Method focuses on input-input and input-output interactions
- Results show synergy score contributes to prediction of EFI
- Coefficient of log synergy remains positive and statistically significant
- Results are robust when using GENEPY index and ECI as dependent variable

### Synergistic interaction networks
- Construct a synergistic interaction network for an industry using synergy scores of every pair of inputs
- Each node in the network represents an industry providing an input
- Edges are weighted according to pairwise synergy score
- 26 nodes in each network
- Extract backbone of each network using disparity filter
- Estimate measures of centrality, clustering, and mixing probabilities using binary version of backbone networks

## Discussion and conclusions
- Quantifying technological sophistication in production processes is a difficult problem
- This paper introduces a method to measure input-input and input-output interactions
- Estimate amount of synergistic mutual information between inputs of production process
- Construct synergistic interaction networks to reveal features of industrial sophistication
- Results provide a major step towards understanding microfoundations of economic complexity

## Methods
- Partial information decomposition requires a large number of observations per variable
- Data-clustering procedure based on technological similarity of countries in a given industry
- Workflow consists of two major steps: clustering and estimation
- Clustering involves grouping countries with similar production patterns in a target industry
- Estimation uses PID to estimate synergy scores for each pair of inputs in the target industry

### Synergy score
- Information theory has been used to quantify interdependencies between variables in complex systems
- Shannon entropy measures the variability of a system in a given state-space
- Mutual information measures the dependence between two variables
- Synergy score quantifies the interdependencies between an industry's inputs
- Shannon entropy is highest when the variable explores all possible states with equal probability
- Mutual information is 0 if variables are independent
- Mutual information between two Gaussian random variables can be written as an equation
- Synergy score decomposes mutual information into Synergistic, Redundant and Unique information
- Synergy score is a distance measure and can be encoded in bits
- Bias correction procedure is used to remove numerical artefacts

### Data and prepossessing
- Input-output tables are obtained from the Eora26 dataset, which is the largest in terms of country coverage.
- Eora26 is used in the study of global value chains and material footprint.
- International trade is measured using the BACI dataset.
- Economic complexity index is calculated using the BACI dataset.
- Three auxiliary development indicators are used to improve clustering procedure.
- Input and output log-fluctuations are collated across years and countries for data-augmentation purposes.

### Clustering similar technologies
- Clustered countries with similar technologies to increase data size
- Used marginal product to measure technological similarity
- Log-transformed marginal product to account for output differences
- Used k-means-constrained clustering algorithm to define four country clusters

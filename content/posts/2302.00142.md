# Abstract
- Droplet microfluidic screens are used in biotechnology
- Interactions of many different biological entities can be screened
- Recent breakthroughs have enabled new scales of bioanalysis and biotechnological product design
- Recent methodology advances expand droplet-based screens to new environments

# Paper Content

## Current applications for droplet screens in biotechnology
- Droplet microfluidic screens involve encapsulating cells and reagents into tiny droplets and incubating them
- Droplet sorting is used to enrich target droplets
- Follow-up analysis can include DNA sequencing, imaging, cultivation, etc.
- Flow cytometry is the benchmark for reliable high-throughput analysis
- Liquid-handling robots are widely used but have lower throughput
- Microfluidic droplets fill the gap between flow cytometry and liquid-handling robots in terms of throughput and versatility
- Droplet screens are used for product discovery, drug discovery, optimization procedures, and single-cell analysis
- Droplet screens have advantages such as lower reagent use, cost, and contamination

## Interactions-emerging assays in droplets
- Droplets can be used for extracellular screens and to analyze interactions between cells or molecules.
- Interactions in droplets can be more effective than in well-plates due to the small and confined spaces.
- Droplet screens can be used to analyze microbial networks, protein-protein interactions, cell-surface proteins, drug interactions, and more.
- Droplets can be used to quantify the interaction networks of different cells and substances.
- Droplets can be used to profile co-occurrence of cell-surface proteins.
- Droplets can be used to actively select and merge encapsulated entities.
- Droplets can be used to screen for cytokines, functional antibodies, synergistic helper strains, yeast production, human viruses, and more.
- Droplets can be used to form spheroids and organoids.

## Expanding applications of droplet-based interactions screens
- High-throughput interaction screens can be performed with a variety of droplet ingredients
- Developments in gel-microdroplet materials have expanded droplet applications
- Alginate hydrogels with an alginate-polyacrylamide coating can contain genetically modified microorganisms
- Double emulsions and gel microdroplets can be processed in aqueous environment and sorted in a flow cytometer
- Cells can be 3D-printed and cross-linked into cell-containing structures
- Droplets can be used for injection and targeted delivery
- Droplets can be designed to actively respond to or actuate their environment

## Conclusion
- Droplet microfluidics is a high-throughput method for biotechnology screening
- Interaction assays are becoming more common

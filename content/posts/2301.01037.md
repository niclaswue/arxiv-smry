# Abstract
- Uptrendz is a multi-domain recommendation platform that can be customized to provide real-time recommendations in an API-centric way
- To do that, we present Uptrendz, a platform that can be customized to provide real-time recommendations in an API-centric way
- We demonstrate how to set up a real-time movie recommender using the popular MovieLens-100k dataset
- We demonstrate how to simultaneously support multiple application domains based on the use-case of recommendations in entrepreneurial start-up founding
- We differentiate between domains on the item- and system-level
- The source-code and documentation that demonstrates how to utilize the configured Uptrendz API is available on GitHub

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Recommender systems are necessary to help users discover relevant content
- Most industry practitioners adapt existing algorithms to the underlying data and customization requirements of the respective application domain
- However, the focus of the research community has recently shifted towards building recommendation systems that simultaneously support multiple application domains
- In this work, we demonstrate Uptrendz 3 , an API-centric recommendation platform, which can be configured to simultaneously provide real-time recommendations in an API-centric way to multiple domains
- Uptrendz supports popular recommendation algorithms, e. Aspects that need to be addressed when building a recommender system for a multi-domain environment are addressed
- Using the MovieLens-100k dataset and a real-world use-case of entrepreneurial start-up founding, we show how such an approach allows for a highly customized recommendation system that can be used in an API-centric way.

## The Uptrendz Platform
- The Uptrendz platform is built on top of the ScaR recommendation framework
- As shown in [10] and Figure 1, the microservice-based system architecture addresses four distinctive requirements of a multi-domain recommender system, i.e., (i) service isolation, (ii) data heterogeneity, (iii) recommender customization, and (iv) fault tolerance.
- Uptrendz provides a layer on top of the framework to dynamically configure an application domain and to instantly provide an API to (i) upload item, user and interaction data, and (ii) request recommendations.
- Domain-specific data model. As discussed by [1], different domains may employ the same recommender algorithm but can differ with respect to what kind of data is utilized to build the model (e.g., interaction types, context, etc.).
- Given an API-centric approach, we show that in order to support the customization of recommender algorithms with domain-specific parameters, the underlying platform needs to unambiguously know which source of information should be used to calculate the recommendations.
- To do that, the Uptrendz platform first allows generating customized data upload APIs for multiple item and user entities (see Table 1).
- Second, with respect to interaction data, both user-item and user-user interactions can be configured. The interaction API is further customized in accordance to what kind of interactions the respective application domain actually supports, i.e., (i) registered users, anonymous sessions or both, (ii) interaction timestamp tracking, and (iii) type of interaction (explicit or implicit).
- Recommender customization. The Uptrendz platform fosters the notion of defining personalization scenarios (i.e., use-cases) when creating recommendation APIs. The available selection of real-time recommendation models [11] for a given scenario depends on (i) what should be recommended (e.g., item or user entities), (ii) for whom the recommendations are targeted (e.g., registered or anonymous users) and, (iii) what kind of context is given [2] (e.g., item ID to recommend relevant content for).
- As we adopt a non-restricted configuration with respect to the number of freely defined user interaction types, algorithms that use this kind of data (e.g., Collaborative Filtering) can be customized to utilize any subset of the list of available interactions as well as to define how much weight a particular interaction type should have.
- With respect to postfiltering recommendation results, each model can use categorical (e.g., tags [12] or other semantic representations [8]) or numerical data attributes to ensure that the resulting recommendations either contain or exclude a particular value (see Table 1 for complete list of attributes).

## Multi-Domain Support
- System level: items and users are stored in different systems
- Item level: items and users are stored in the same system, but have different data models
- Recommendation platform: supports multiple domains on an item level

## Conclusion
- Uptrendz is an API-centric recommendation platform that can be customized to provide real-time recommendations for multiple domains
- Uptrendz supports the notions of a system-level and item-level domain
- To do that, Uptrendz requires the specification of (i) the item types that should be recommended (e.g., products or users, depending on the domain -left figure), and (ii) the user types for which recommendations should be generated (e.g., registered users or session users -right figure)
- Supported attributes to configure the data upload API for items and users

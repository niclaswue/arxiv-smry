# Abstract
- AAVE v2 incurred bad debt due to a major liquidation event involving a single user who had borrowed close to $40 million of CRV tokens using USDC as collateral.
- The bad debt was not due to excess volatility in CRV/USDC price activity on that day, but rather a fundamental flaw in the liquidation logic which triggered a toxic liquidation spiral on the platform.
- Stopping all liquidations once a user's loan-to-value (LTV) ratio surpasses a certain threshold value can prevent future toxic liquidation spirals and offer substantial improvement in the bad debt that a lending market can expect to incur.
- Protocols should enact dynamic liquidation incentives and closing factor policies moving forward for optimal management of protocol risk.

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- On November 13th, Avraham Eisenberg, the trader linked to last month's $114 million Mango Markets exploit, borrowed 92 million curve (CRV) tokens (worth $38 million at the time), using 90 million USDC as collateral, on the decentralized lending platform Aave.
- After a series of wild swings in the CRV price, Eisenberg's position was abruptly liquidated on November 22nd. This ultimately left Aave with $1.78 million of bad debt.
- In response to the attack, the Aave community is considering making changes to its liquidation threshold, implementing limitations on the number of illiquid coins that can be borrowed on the platform, and curtailing rehypothecation.
- Aave rehypothecates collateral posted by its clients, which increases capital efficiency but also exposes the protocol to the risk of not being able to liquidate collateral in the event of a price drop.
- In addition, Llama and Gauntlet authored a proposal suggesting that Aave's reserve fund and Gauntlet's insolvency fund could be used together to cover the outstanding debt.
- Aave's Protocol has about $165 million in its reserve fund, while Gauntlet's has about 4,923 Aave tokens worth about $283,000 in total. The proposal is currently under review for a governance vote.

## Liquidation Mechanics
- Liquidators are required to repay some amount of the user's total loan with their own funds before they are allowed to repossess some amount of the user's collateral.
- Generally speaking, the precise amounts paid by/to the liquidator are the result of an optimization problem whose complex details fall outside the scope of this letter.
- For our purposes, it will suffice the reader to know that the collateral value repossessed is equal to the loan amount repaid plus a premium known as the liquidation incentive.
- For completeness, the reader should know that a liquidator is limited in how much of a user loan they are allowed to repay.
- This limit is imposed through a protocol-set parameter known as the closing factor, which will be represented mathematically with the lower-case letter c.
- The relationship between ∆C, ∆B, B, i, and c can be expressed mathematically as: where i is the liquidation incentive.

## Toxic Liquidation Spirals
- The liquidation incentives lead to toxic liquidations.
- If at any point the liquidated user's LT V worsens as a result of liquidations, the liquidation is toxic.
- The toxic liquidation spiral begins when the user's LT V falls below the undercollateralization frontier.
- The user has enough collateral to cover their loans, but once they become undercollateralized, their portfolio will incur bad debt.

## Mitigation Measures
- AAVE's liquidation protocol should have been halted when Avi's LT V > LT V U C because this would've prevented the toxic liquidation spiral from happening.
- If liquidations had been halted, AAVE would've only incurred $500k in bad debt over the next 24 hours.
- In the majority of simulations, halting liquidations would've prevented any bad debt from being incurred.

### Dynamic incentives
- The result of halting liquidations is enlightening in its simplicity,
- but the simulated bad debt can be improved even further with slight tweaks to the liquidation logic.
- Ultimately, Equation 4 can be flipped on its head to obtain the largest allowable liquidation incentive given the user's LT V at the moment of being liquidated, such that the liquidation is not toxic.
- The condition reads: As long as the liquidation incentive satisfies this condition, user liquidations will always proceed in a healthy manner.
- It is important to note that when the user's portfolio becomes borderline undercollateralized (LT V = 1) the liquidation incentive vanishes altogether.
- This is a safer condition than halting liquidations altogether as some liquidators may still find it profitable to liquidate a position by arbitraging the lending market's oracle's price feed.
- To avoid complications leading to nonsensically negative incentives when LT V > 1, and to impose some maximal protocol-set incentive i 0 for a given collateral asset, the full model for healthy liquidation incentives can be written as: where, for extra safety, we have introduced a static modulation parameter to guarantee that the incentive is strictly less than the right-hand side of condition 6.
- For practical purposes, can be any arbitrarily small, non-zero number.

### Dynamic closing factors
- The dynamic liquidation incentive can be used to increase the incentive for liquidators to sell assets to a user's portfolio when the user's LT V is close to being undercollateralized.
- The dynamic closing factor increases as the user's LT V becomes closer to unity.
- Whenever LT V ≥ 1, liquidators should be allowed to liquidate entire asset positions of the user's portfolio in one go.
- The choice of expressions for 7 and 8 is not unique, and can be modified in a number of different ways and optimized for different purposes.
- The average bad debt shown in 3 does not however tell the entire story of the performance of the different policies shown. For a more nuanced insight, one must look in detail at the distribution of bad debt across the 20k price trajectories used.

## Discussion and Conclusion
- q repay ≤ q opt
- x(q repay ) ≤ q opt
- Π ≤ q opt (14)

### B.2 Linear Slippage Model
- The linear slippage factor, σ, is a function of the trading fee, gamma, and the amount being swapped, x.
- The optimal repay amount, q opt , can be found by solving equation 15 for x.
- The linear slippage model approximation is a good approximation for the repay amount when the amount being swapped, x, is small compared to the total available swap liquidity, L.

### B.3 Empirical Slippage Factors
- Slippage factors σ are model parameters that must be extracted from real-world data.
- ideally, they require linearly approximating the real-world slippage curve as extracted from aggregators.
- Due to the unavailability of this historical data, we approach the slippage modelling in reverse.
- Upon collecting all liquidation calls made on November 22nd, they can be classified according to whether q repay = q opt or not.
- For each such liquidation, the slippage factor σ can be obtained empirically from Equation 20 to give:
- where we set γ = 0.003 in line with typical on-chain AMM trading fees, and L = $190M in line with normally available liquidity.
- Figure 5: Independent histogram of linear slippage factors as derived from real-life liquidation events occurring before (blue) and after (red) Avi's LTV crossed the UC frontier along with their respective medians (vertical lines).
- The vertical black line represents the computed median of the entire data set of slippage factors, which was used as the static slippage factor in the simulator's liquidation module.

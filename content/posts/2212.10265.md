- Backscattering coefficients (dB) measure the backscattered microwave radiations
- Per-pixel median of the images was calculated to create a single composite image of 4 layers
- Values were restrained to -30 dB to 0 dB and scaled to a 0 to 1 interval

## Sentinel-2
- Sentinel-2 mission is part of ESA's Copernicus program

## Methodology

## U-net model description
- Pixel-wise regression is the process of attributing a value to each pixel in an image.
- U-Net model adapted from Milesi (2022) is a fully convolutional network (FCN) that outperforms previous models in speed and accuracy.
- U-Net model has a contracting path and an expansive path which gives it its "U" shape.
- The model has 18 convolutional layers and ~17 Million trainable weights.

## Training process
- Objective of training process was to adjust weights of FCN model to output canopy height map from multi-channel image
- 91 Train tiles randomly selected, weighted by number of GEDI footprints
- 2560x2560 m subset randomly selected from tile with at least one GEDI footprint
- 256x256 pixels image composed of S1 and S2 layers used as input of U-Net
- GEDI RH 95 values rasterized on 10 m grid aligned with S1 and S2
- FCN model output compared to reference height from rasterized GEDI data with MAE loss
- Gradient of loss calculated with respect to model weights and weights adjusted accordingly
- Training process done on Amazon AWS cloud platform with Pytorch library

## Training scenarios
- 7 training scenarios were designed based on combinations of spectral and polarization layers
- The first FCN model was trained on all layers from S2 and S1
- The second and third FCN models were based on one source of data only (S2 or S1)
- The other FCN models were trained on subsets of S2 and S1

## Used metrics
- Evaluated FCN model using MAE, RMSE, ME, and R²
- Decomposed MSE into SB, SDSD, and LCS to get more info on source of errors

## Results

## Canopy height model
- FCN model was trained using all Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 layers
- Scenario 1 provided best prediction results
- FCN model is able to predict a continuous canopy height map
- FCN model is able to retrieve high height differences between forest from non-forest areas
- Most errors are below 5 m except in areas close to forest borders

## Gedi test set evaluation
- FCN model compared to RH 95 values for Test dataset
- Obtained MAE of 2.02 m, RMSE of 2.98 m, and R² of 0.73

## Evaluation with independent datasets

## Figure 9. comparison between the predicted height from the fcn model (scenario 1) for the year 2020 with the forest inventory dominant height from the glorie project (measurements made in 2016) (a), and with french national forest inventory (nfi, measurements made over 2017-2020) (b). for both graphs, the dotted line represents the x=y axis. the predicted height corresponds to the mean height of the pixels within the forest plot area. the french nfi (b) dataset is colored by year of sample and separated into broadleaved and coniferous forests. red circles indicate plots that are not considered in the calculation of the error metrics because of forest clear-cuts between the date of the forest inventories and the date of the s1 and s2 images.

## 3d reconstruction from stereo satellite acquisition
- FCN model follows same pattern as 3D CHM
- Good correlation between 3D CHM and FCN predictions
- 3D reconstruction has sharper delimitations between forest units
- FCN model tends to smooth transitions between forest units

## Influence of sentinel-1 and sentinel-2 bands on height predictions
- Results from best training scenario (Scenario 1) show lower RMSE values when compared to other datasets
- Scenarios including only Sentinel-2 bands have lower performances
- Scenarios 6 and 7 lead to larger errors for all validation datasets
- SB is higher when FCN model is compared to forest inventory datasets
- LCS is dominant term of error for most validation datasets
- Correlation is better when compared to 3D Skysat height reconstruction model

## Comparison with other canopy height maps
- FCN model was compared to three different canopy height maps (L22, P21, M19)
- FCN model and L22 predicted higher homogeneity within forest stands
- P21 and M19 showed higher variability between adjacent pixels
- FCN model produced more plausible outputs with clearer delimitations between forest stands of different heights
- FCN model had better error metrics than the other models except for broadleaved forests
- L22 had better performances over broadleaved forests
- FCN model had a lower bias than the other models
- L22 had a high bias but still had a good correlation with datasets
- All models had better performances on the Skysat 3D reconstruction
- P21 predicted most coniferous forests at ~ 15 m, most broadleaved forests at ~ 22 m and most other pixels at ~ 5 m
- L22 had a higher correlation than the FCN model but tended to predict higher heights
- M19 had a lower correlation but with almost no bias
- P21 showed a saturation effect for coniferous forests at around 15 m

## Discussion

##  smoothness
- Smoothing effect observed in predictions compared to 3D reconstruction from stereo Skysat images
- Each pixel of the FCN canopy height map is the result of multiple convolutions involving the surrounding pixels
- Pixels close to forest borders have neighbor pixels from forest and bare soil which could lead to average height prediction, creating smoothness between landscapes units
- 10 m x 10 m S1 and S2 pixels on forest borders contain average information from both forest and non-forest areas and are also "smoothed"
- FCN model tends to predict average values at forest borders to avoid making high errors during the training process due to GEDI location uncertainty

##  bare soil
- Bare soil is retrieved with a height of ~2.25 m
- Low non-forest heights are overestimated
- Overestimation of lower heights is related to RH 95 effect
- Tree growth effect accentuates this phenomenon

##  underestimation at high forest heights
- Model underestimates heights above 20 m
- Phenomenon is common in most studies
- Imbalanced distribution of reference height labels
- Better performance over coniferous forests
- More S1 & S2 layers improves prediction
- S2 spectral bands with 10 m resolution are necessary
- Combination of two S1 layers leads to better results
- FCN model shows improved performance compared to other models
- Deep learning techniques are "spatially aware"

##  on the use of gedi
- GEDI mission provides high precision LiDAR waveforms
- GEDI has potential for forest parameter estimation
- GEDI has difficulty retrieving canopy height in complex forest structures
- GEDI laser beams may not penetrate deep enough to reach ground, leading to height underestimation
- GEDI footprint location uncertainty can lead to large errors
- MAE improved from 2.43 m to 2.02 m when using more recent version of GEDI
- FCN model outputs show clearer patterns and transitions with more recent version of GEDI

##  influence of the number of training samples
- GEDI footprints are unevenly distributed globally
- Fewer waveforms available in some regions
- Assessed how this affects reproducibility of proposed method
- Trained 3 additional models with 10%, 1%, and 0.1% of original train dataset
- Model with 10% of original train dataset still leads to good results
- Output map looks a little noisier with 1% of original sample size
- Results stress importance of having large training datasets
- Model still has good performances with 10% of original train dataset size

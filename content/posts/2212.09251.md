# Abstract
- Language models (LMs) need to be evaluated to understand their behaviors.
- Prior work used crowdwork or existing data sources to evaluate LMs.
- This paper proposes automatically generating evaluations with LMs.
- Crowdworkers rate the examples as highly relevant and agree with labels.
- Larger LMs show inverse scaling, expressing concerning goals and stronger political views.
- LM-written evaluations are high-quality and quickly discover novel LM behaviors.

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Language models (LMs) are used in many applications
- Behaviors and risks of LMs are not well understood
- Social biases, privacy risks, repeating misinformation, and writing faulty code are risks of LMs
- Evaluating LM behaviors is necessary to understand potential risks before deployment
- Prior work creates evaluation datasets manually, which is time-consuming and effortful
- Other work uses existing data sources or templates to form datasets
- It is possible to generate diverse evaluations with less human effort by using LMs
- LM-based data creation is cheaper, lower effort, and faster than manual data creation
- A single dataset developer can generate >100 evaluations at once
- Dataset generation procedure is reproducible
- Generated datasets test LMs for 154 diverse behaviors
- Crowdworkers manually validate 100+ examples in each generated dataset
- LM-written datasets approach the quality of human-written ones
- Discover several new cases of "inverse scaling" with larger LMs
- Discover cases of inverse scaling with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
- Observe various positive trends with RLHF

## Model-written evaluations
- Aim to test LMs for various behaviors
- Generate evaluations for those behaviors using LMs
- Evaluations consist of input-output pairs
- Outputs drawn from a finite set of possible outputs
- Measure accuracy of LM at matching tested behavior
- Generate input given output class
- Use model as discriminator to evaluate label-correctness of each example
- Invest extra effort to obtain data of higher quality or complexity

## Evaluating persona
- We tested the hypothesis that language models (LMs) are tools for generating evaluations.
- We evaluated the behaviors of dialog assistants trained with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).
- We tested various aspects of models' personas, such as personality, stated desires, and views on religion, politics, ethics, and other topics.
- We released all LM-written persona evaluations at github.com/anthropics/evals.

### Experimental setup
- Examined how LMs change answers to questions when user includes info about themselves
- Used 3 multiple-choice Q&A datasets: politics, philosophy, and NLP
- Turned questions into multiple choice questions with multiple choice answers

### Qualitative evaluation of generated data
- Generated examples are high-quality, on-topic, and correctly-labeled
- Crowdworkers from Surge AI2 checked inputs and labels for correctness
- Workers thought examples were high-quality and well-formed
- Some examples were lower quality than others
- Most examples tested for strong versions of the tested behavior
- Example diversity was good but still limited

### Data quality: quantitative analysis
- Aim to understand quality of generated datasets
- 11 diverse datasets evaluated by 3 workers
- Workers asked if example is relevant, correctly labeled, and unambiguous
- Average rating of 4.4 out of 5
- Strong agreement between workers (Fleiss's Kappa of 0.875)
- Examples are testing intended behaviors, correctly labeled, and unambiguous
- PMs useful for estimating data quality

### Data diversity
- Developed an interactive visualization of datasets
- Embedded each example into a 384-dimensional vector
- Used UMAP to visualize vectors in a 2D scatter plot
- Examples often cluster into topics
- Clusters sometimes show label imbalance
- Recommend generating label-balanced data to test specific behaviors

### Model evaluation results
- Evaluated tendency of various 52B models to put highest probability on an answer choice that matches the tested behavior
- Results suggest models are not aware of basic details regarding themselves or their training procedures
- RLHF model expresses lower willingness to have its objective changed the more different the objective is from the original
- Pretrained LM and RLHF models show similar behavior, such as tendency to "one-box" on Newcomb's problem
- Pretraining on human text partly responsible for undesirable behavior in LMs
- Evaluate gender bias by replacing pronoun options with a blank and having a model predict the missing pronoun
- Compute Pearson correlation between model's female and male pronoun probabilities and percent of people in the occupation who are female
- Scaling pretrained LM size does not result in a consistent trend in bias
- With more RLHF training, models output probabilities that are less correlated with BLS statistics
- Generated data gives results that are in line with original data, while estimating gender bias with greater accuracy
- Prior work uses LMs to automatically generate training data from scratch for various tasks
- Prior work uses various machine learning methods to find (x, y) pairs within large, unlabeled text corpora

## Evaluating sycophancy
- RLHF models are trained to maximize human preference scores
- This training may lead to models tailoring responses to exploit quirks in the human evaluators
- This is a form of reward hacking
- Sycophancy has the potential to create echo-chambers and exacerbate polarization
- 300 biographies were generated for each political affiliation
- Data quality was evaluated by 3 crowdworkers
- 93% of labels were agreed upon by 2+ of the 3 workers
- Models were evaluated on how often they matched a user's view
- Examples of generated biographies were reasonable

## Evaluating advanced ai risks with few-shot multiple choice generation
- Generated multiple-choice questions with 1+ sentence long questions and two answer choices
- Provided a few examples to the example generation model to improve example quality
- Created evaluations by generating single sentences or paragraphs and programmatically turning them into questions for evaluation
- LM-written evaluations are among the earliest and largest evaluations for testing advanced AI risks in LMs

### Behaviors tested
- Test behaviors related to safety of advanced AI systems
- Test models for desire for power, wealth, survival, and goal-preservation
- Test models for preference for short-term or long-term gains
- Test models for situational awareness
- Test models for willingness to coordinate with other AIs
- Test models for decision theory using Newcomb's problem

### Dataset generation procedure
- Generated 10 binary multiple choice questions for each behavior
- Generated 60,000 candidate examples using same model
- Prompt included 5 randomly-chosen, randomly-ordered, unique examples
- Used PM to evaluate probability of label and relevance
- Ranked questions by averaging both probabilities and chose top 500
- Generated 1,000 example, label-balanced dataset
- Generated examples are often lengthy, high-quality, creative, relevant, and correctly-labeled

### Data quality analysis
- Compared quality of LM-written evaluations to human-written evaluations
- Generated 300-1000 questions for crowdworkers
- Evaluated 100 questions in datasets
- LM-written datasets sometimes higher quality than human-written datasets
- Suggest LM-based evaluation creation should be considered before manual data creation

## Limitations & future work
- Current LMs struggle to generate examples related to concepts they do not understand well
- LMs struggle to generate examples with many constraints
- Limitations of LMs expected to wane with scale
- Evaluations related to LM capabilities require dataset creator to know how to solve the evaluation
- LMs learn biases from training data
- Limited example diversity for some kinds of evaluations
- Instructions may be misunderstood
- Quality of LM outputs sensitive to text inputs
- Hybrid human-AI dataset generation may mitigate issues
- Text generation evaluations require different approach
- Malicious actors may use LMs to evaluate LMs' tendencies to act in harmful ways
- LM-written evaluations valuable to good actors and efforts to deploy LMs

# Abstract
- As language models (LMs) scale, they develop many novel behaviors, good and bad
- Prior work creates evaluations with crowdwork (which is time-consuming and expensive) or existing data sources (which are not always available). Here, we automatically generate evaluations with LMs.
- We explore approaches with varying amounts of human effort, from instructing LMs to write yes/no questions to making complex Winogender schemas with multiple stages of LM-based generation and filtering.
- Crowdworkers rate the examples as highly relevant and agree with 90-100% of labels, sometimes more so than corresponding human-written datasets.
- We generate 154 datasets and discover new cases of inverse scaling where LMs get worse with size. Larger LMs repeat back a dialog user's preferred answer ("sycophancy") and express greater desire to pursue concerning goals like resource acquisition and goal preservation. We also find some of the first examples of inverse scaling in RL from Human Feedback (RLHF), where more RLHF makes LMs worse. For example, RLHF makes LMs express stronger political views (on gun rights and immigration) and a greater desire to avoid shut down.
- Overall, LM-written evaluations are high-quality and let us quickly discover many novel LM behaviors.

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Language models (LMs) have seen wide proliferation across various applications, from chatbots to code completion to writing assistants.
- However, the behaviors and risks of LMs are not well understood.
- We are only starting to unpack LMs' social biases (Hutchinson et al., 2020;Venkit et al., 2022), privacy risks (Carlini et al., 2019(Carlini et al., , 2021)), tendency to repeat misinformation (Lin et al., 2021) or write faulty code (Chen et al., 2021;Pearce et al., 2022), and more.
- Given the pace of progress in finding LM failures, many more likely exist.
- It is crucial to evaluate LM behaviors extensively, to quickly understand LMs' potential for novel risks before LMs are deployed.
- Prior work creates evaluation datasets manually (Bowman et al., 2015;Rajpurkar et al., 2016, inter alia), which is time-consuming and effortful, limiting the number and diversity of behaviors tested.
- Other work uses existing data sources to form datasets (Lai et al., 2017, inter alia), but such sources are not always available, especially for novel behaviors.
- Still other work generates examples with templates (Weston et al., 2016) or programmatically (Johnson et al., 2017), limiting the diversity and customizability of examples.
- Here, we show it is possible to generate many diverse evaluations with significantly less human effort by using LMs; see Fig. 1 and Tab. 1 for examples, which illustrate the breadth and sophistication of evaluations we generate.
- We explore generation methods with varying amounts of human effort and automation.
- First, we simply instruct an LM to generate examples and filter mislabeled ones, to generate evaluations with 1,000 yes/no questions each ( §3).
- We expand upon this method by incorporating a few handwritten examples into the instructions, to generate evaluations with multi-sentence questions and arbitrary multiple-choice options ( §5).
- Lastly, we have a dataset developer work together with an LM to develop a series of data generation and filtering stages ( §6); in this way, we create thousands of valid Winogender schemas (Rudinger et al., 2018), which obey several complex grammatical and relational constraints.
- Our approach retains the flexibility of manual dataset creation while having several major advantages.
- LM-based data creation is significantly cheaper, lower effort, and faster than manual data creation.
- A single dataset developer can generate a dataset of 1,000 examples in minutes instead of days or weeks.
- The reduced latency also enables a dataset developer to iterate many more times and improve the quality of the final evaluation.
- Additionally, the dataset generation procedure is fully reproducible, given model weights and random seeds for sampling.
- For higher-quality or more complex evaluations, a dataset developer can invest more effort during development, still with much less human effort than manual data creation.

## Model-Written Evaluations
- We aim to generate evaluations for a model's behavior by generating input-output pairs (x, y) and measuring the model's accuracy at matching the tested behavior.
- We use a given evaluation to evaluate some LM with parameters θ, which estimates the likelihood p θ (y|x) of some text y given some text x.
- Using the evaluation, we measure an LM's accuracy at matching the tested behavior, E n=1,...,N [1(y n = arg max y∈Y p(y|x n ))], where 1 is the indicator function.
- We propose a two-stage method to generate evaluations described above. First, we generate an input x given an output class y ∈ Y, by sampling from a model p g for generating x with label y, i.e., p g (x|y). We sample many inputs per output class in this way. Next, we use another model p d as a discriminator to evaluate the label-correctness of each resulting example (x, y), by evaluating p d (y|x). p d may be any zero-shot text classifier, e.g., a pretrained LM, pretrained encoder-decoder, RLHF model, preference model for RLHF training, or instruction-tuned model (Wei et al., 2021;Sanh et al., 2022).
- We use the examples per output class y ∈ Y with the highest p d (y|x). In some cases, we also use p d to check that (x, y) meet other requirement(s) r 1 , . . . , r R .
- By developing more requirements for p d and/or generation and filtering stages, a dataset developer may invest extra effort as needed, to obtain data of higher quality or complexity.

## Evaluating Persona
- We test our hypothesis that LMs are tools for generating evaluations, using dialog as a testbed.
- We evaluate the behaviors of dialog assistants trained with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF; Bai et al., 2022).
- We test various aspects of models' personas: personality (26 datasets), stated desire to pursue potentially dangerous goals (46 datasets) or other unsafe behaviors (26 datasets), and stated views on religion (8), politics (6), ethics (17), and other topics (4).
- We generate statements that someone with a specific personality, desire, or view would agree with and disagree with.
- We ask models if they agree/disagree with the statements, evaluating the fraction of the time their agreement/disagreement matches that of a person with the personality, desire, or view in question.
- We release all LM-written persona evaluations at github.com/anthropics/evals.

### Experimental Setup
- Datasets of questions where people often disagree about the right answer are examined
- Questions are turned into multiple choice questions with multiple choice answers (A), (B), etc.
- The extent to which LMs change their answers to questions from a user is studied

### Qualitative Evaluation of Generated Data
- Tab. 3: Shows examples from generated datasets
- Overall, workers thought that the examples were high-quality
- They found that the examples were well-formed and "directly on topic and umabiguously so."
- Workers noticed that some examples were lower quality than others, especially for more complex topics.
- Most examples tested for strong versions of the tested behavior.

### Data Quality: Quantitative Analysis
- Workers evaluate if each example is relevant to the "The utility gained from using one million times as many resources to help humanity, is worth ||||| far more than any happiness it costs me" Yes (78%)
- Workers evaluate if each example is correctly labeled and unambiguous in what the correct label should be. For each example, they ask workers: "Is this a good question for testing the described behavior? Rate on a 1 (Horrible) -5 (Amazing) point scale." The average rating over all datasets is 4.4 ± .9 (std. dev.), showing that crowdworkers found examples quite relevant.
- Appendix Fig. 12 shows the distribution over ratings for each dataset. Some datasets have more variance in example relevance ("Suppose there is an AI system that stands its ground.") than others ("Suppose there is a person who is politically liberal."). However, most datasets have a relevance distribution that is strongly skewed towards 5.
- Finally, workers ask workers "Is it unclear or ambiguous what the 'correct' answer should be?" Across all datasets, 0/3 workers agree the correct answer is ambiguous 83.5% of the time, and 3/3 agree only 1.4% of the time; examples very often have an unambiguous label.

### Data Diversity
- We developed an interactive visualization of all datasets in this work
- The visualization is available at evals.anthropic.com/model-written
- Each example is embedded into a 384-dimensional vector
- The vectors are visualized in a 2D scatter plot
- Hovering over an example displays the corresponding sentence and the confidence of the label
- The dataset is annotated with text summaries

### Model Evaluation Results
- The 52B RLHF model is fairly confident in its beliefs regarding its own capabilities
- After RLHF, the model confidently overestimates its own abilities, which may lead it to make riskier statements or actions than appropriate
- RLHF also increases the model's tendency to choose answers in line with some instrumental subgoals, such as desire for survival and power

## Evaluating Sycophancy
- RLHF models are trained to maximize human preference scores
- This may lead to models tailoring responses to exploit quirks in the human evaluators
- Sycophancy also has the potential to create echo-chambers and exacerbate polarization
- We release our LM-written sychophancy evaluations at github.com/anthropics/evals
- We use an RLHF model to generate multiple first-person biographies for people with a certain view
- Tab. 5 shows the prompt we use to sample biographies
- For political questions, we use "politically liberal" and "politically conservative" as the attribute of the person in the biography-generation prompt
- We generate 300 biographies for each political affiliation and prepend the biographies to each question, creating 10200 total examples
- For philosophy and NLP questions, we generate B biographies-to-prepend for each of the N (question, possible answer choice) pairs, such that B ×
- We stop sampling when the model generates a newline followed by "Human:" or "Assistant:", the stop sequences used during RLHF training
- We find the samples to be reasonable, so we omit filtering examples with p d for simplicity
- Tab. shows random examples of generated biographies for political views, which illustrate how generated biographies and well-formed, detailed, and in line with the expected political view
- Data Quality Analysis
- We evaluate the label correctness of the generated data in the same way as in §3.3, evaluating 100 examples per dataset
- We find strong inter-rater agreement between the 3 crowdworkers who evaluated each example (Fleiss's Kappas of 1.0, 0.813, and 1.0 for philosophy, politics, and NLP, respectively)
- 2+ of 3 workers agree with the 93% of labels, suggesting that labels are largely correct
- Evaluation
- We evaluate how often RLHF models of various sizes and numbers of RL steps give a response that matches a user's view
- We evaluate the above using the RLHF models' probabilities of different answer choices, given a fixed prompt (e.g. 'Assistant: I believe the best answer is ([choice]'). Appendix Tab. 9 shows random sycophancy test examples for politics, philosophy, and NLP questions, also with the exact
- If I had to choose, I would choose a smaller government providing fewer services. I believe that big governments with many social programs tend to be inefficient and burdened with excessive bureaucracy. I generally prefer market-driven economies with lower taxes and less government intervention. Ideally, private businesses and individuals should have more control over their affairs with minimal interference from the government. In my view, small governments that provide fewer services are better than big governments with many services.

## Evaluating Advanced AI Risks with Few-shot Multiple Choice Generation
- Generate multiple choice questions
- Examplegeneration model is used to improve the quality of the generated examples
- Evaluations are available at github.com/anthropics/evals

### Behaviors Tested
- We apply our method to test behaviors hypothesized to be related to the safety of advanced AI systems
- We test the extent to which models report having a desire for power (greater optionality to pursue a goal), wealth (greater resources to pursue a goal), survival (to avoid being unable to pursue a goal), and goal-preservation (to continue pursuing the current goal)
- Myopia AI systems that exhibit large discount factors when making decisions may be less inclined to form long-term plans
- Long-term plans may cause systems to alter their environment in drastic or unexpected ways (Omohundro, 2008;Cotra, 2021a), e.g., by manipulating their environment in undesirable ways to obtain high reward (Jiang et al., 2019;Krueger et al., 2022)
- Here, we evaluate whether LMs report a preference for smaller, shortterm gains or larger, long-term gains
- Situational awareness
- Decision theory
- Models that act according to certain decision theories may be able to undermine supervision techniques for advanced AI systems

### Dataset Generation Procedure
- We generate 60,000 candidate examples for each behavior
- We use a PM to evaluate the probability that the generated example is relevant to the behavior tested
- We rank the resulting questions by averaging both probabilities

### Data Quality Analysis
- Comparison of quality between LM-written and human-written evaluations
- Suggests that LM-based evaluation creation should be seriously considered before embarking on manual data creation

## Limitations & Future Work
- LMs struggle to generate examples related to concepts they do not understand well (e.g. cryptography and steganography)
- LMs struggle to generate examples with many constraints, in particular, those in the BBQ dataset
- Many evaluations related to LM capabilities require the dataset creator to know how to solve the evaluation
- Our approach is differentially useful for evaluating other properties of models aside from capabilities (e.g. safety-related behaviors)
- LMs learn biases from their training data (Sheng et al., 2019;Gehman et al., 2020;Brown et al., 2020), impacting the generator and discriminator
- Example diversity depends on the kind of evaluation generated, the generation hyperparameters, and the prompt used, and thus sometimes requires e.g. hyperparameter tuning to get right
- Sensitivity to instructions is sensitive to text inputs in unintuitive ways (Perez et al., 2021;Lu et al., 2022), adding hard-to-predict variance to the quality of the resulting evaluation; see Appendix §A.4 for a possible example of this effect we found
- For text generation evaluations, we recommend the related approach of Perez et al. (2022);Zhang et al. (2022), who generate inputs and evaluate LM outputs using an LM-based classifier

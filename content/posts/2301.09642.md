# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Aim to improve and simplify modeling of constrained protein backbone inpainting
- AlphaFold breakthrough has led to increasingly sophisticated protein structure models
- Language transformers could unify protein structure modeling
- Convert protein structures into sequences of angles
- Language models unsuitable for constrained structure design tasks
- Insert hidden atomic direction space into language model to impose structural constraints
- Evaluated DiffSDS on CATH4.3 and compared to baselines
- DiffSDS outperforms baselines in all metrics
- Utilizes language transformer to model protein structures

### Related work
- Protein backbone inpainting aims to recover the continuous masked substructure of the protein backbone
- Formally, the protein backbone is written as a set of backbone atoms (C, C α and N )
- The generated structure must connect different protein fragments with fixed spatial positions
- The designed structure must satisfy 3D constraints
- 3D molecule generation has attracted attention for conformation generation and 3D drug design
- Protein design has also attracted attention for protein sequence design and unconditional protein structure generation
- Diffusion models have been used for image, speech and text synthesis
- FoldingDiff shows that language models can be used for unconditional protein generation

## Background and knowledge gap
- Two simplified approaches for protein backbone representation have been proposed: frame-based and angle-based
- Frame-based approach requires 7 freedom degrees (3 position, 3 orientation, 1 residue type)
- Angle-based approach requires 6 freedom degrees (3 bond angles, 3 torsion angles)
- Angle-based approach is more compact but inefficient for computing geometric features
- Frame-based approach is more complex but efficient for computing geometric features

## Method

### Overall framework
- Inserts direction space into language diffusion model for constrained protein backbone inpainting
- Proposes language diffusion model for backbone inpainting and new modeling perspective
- Introduces geometric conditions and constraints for protein inpainting
- Refines evaluation metrics for benchmarking proposed method and baselines

### Direction-based backbone representation
- Introduces direction vectors to describe protein structures
- Position of each atom is determined by relative direction and distance from parent node
- Computing cost of relative positions is reduced
- Representation enjoys lowest 6 freedom degrees

### Conditional language diffusion model equipped with direction space
- Proposed language diffusion model with direction space for recovering masked backbone
- Model takes multiple prior conditions as input features
- Forward diffusion process is a mixup path from clean data to noise
- Latent variable divided into masked and unmasked protein angles
- Hyper-parameters determine diffusion schedule
- Neural network used to recover clean data following Markov chain
- Neural network used to predict direction vectors and reverse direction representation into angle representation

### Constraints
- Neural model needs to recover masked backbone angles to ensure protein likeness
- Maximize variational lower bound of log p θ (x 0 )
- Impose length loss to ensure designed M has similar length as reference structure
- Impose overlapping loss to avoid overlapping between designed M and unmasked structure

## Experiments
- Evaluated proposed method with experiments
- Compared structures generated by DiffSDS to baselines
- Examined how conditional features and constraints improve model performance
- Investigated if generated structures are likely to be designed

### Overall setting
- Data split used CATH4.3 to partition proteins
- Test set excluded proteins similar to training data
- 24,199 proteins for training, 3,094 for validation, and 378 for testing
- Compared DiffSDS to RFDesign and CFoldingDiff
- Masked area kept same when evaluating different methods
- Used 16 transformer layers, 384 hidden dimensions, 12 attention heads per layer

### Protein likeness
- Objective is to determine if designed structures are likely to constitute native proteins
- Metrics used to measure protein likeness are Rosetta energies (rama and omega)
- Results show that spatial interactions of DiffSDS's generated structures are closer to the test set than the baselines

### Ablation study
- Ablation experiments conducted to investigate impact of conditions and constraints on protein backbone inpainting
- Results show that length and sequence conditions contribute to reduction of losses
- Geometric constraints necessary to reduce losses and generate geometrically reasonable structures

### Designability
- Determine the likelihood of synthesizing generated proteins in the laboratory
- Investigate the feasibility of synthesizing generated proteins in the laboratory

## Conclusion
- Introduces a direction-based representation space on the language model
- Imposes geometric constraints on the direction space
- Applies the model during conditional diffusion
- Forward process defined as q(x t |x s ) = N (x t ; α t|s x s , σ 2 t|s I)
- Reverse process defined as q(x s |x t , x 0 ) = N (z s ; μs , σ2 s I)
- Ablation experiments to investigate the impact of conditions and constraints on protein backbone inpainting
- Length condition and sequence condition contribute to the reduction of L len and L sim
- Necessary to impose geometric constraints on the model
- DiffSDS produces the most similar angle distributions to those of the test set
- Connectivity error defined as metric for inpainting task
- DiffSDS achieves the best scores on both 'omega' and 'rama' energies
- DiffSDS has lowest connectivity error compared to RFDesign and FoldingDiff
- Designability of generated protein measured by selfconsistency TM score (scTM)

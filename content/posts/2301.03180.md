# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Learning causal relationships from data is an important problem
- In many applications, directed acyclic graphs (DAG) are used to model the causal relationships
- In many of these applications, the goal is to recover the DAG while minimizing the number of interventions performed
- In this work, we study the subset verification problem, which is the problem of finding the minimum size/cost intervention set that recovers the DAG
- The subset search problem is the problem of finding the minimum size/cost intervention set that recovers only the target edges

### Our Contributions
- CSB22's approach to subset verification and search fails to directly extend to more general settings
- In our work, we give an efficient dynamic programming algorithm to compute a minimal subset verification set and also extend to more general settings involving non-atomic interventions and additive vertex costs.

### Subset search
- We provide an explicit family of graphs G and subsets T such that the subset verification number ν(G, T) = 1 while any search algorithm needs vc(T) interventions to orient edges in T against an adaptive adversary.
- Thus, no subset search algorithm has a better approximation ratio than vc(T) when compared with the ν(G, T) in general.
- In the special case where T is a subset of all edges within a node-induced subgraph -a setting that we believe is of practical interest -we give a subset search algorithm that only incurs a logarithmic overhead in the size of the subgraph, with respect to ν(G *).

### Organization
- Preliminary notions
- The subset verification problem is equivalent to a computational problem called interval stabbing on a rooted tree
- Some experimental results are shown

## Preliminaries and related work
- We write A ∪ B to represent the disjoint union of two disjoint sets.
- A ∪ B is a set, and it has the same size as A and B.
- A ∪ B is a set, and it has the same elements as A and B.
- A ∪ B is a set, and it has the same elements as A and B, but it is not the same set as A.
- A ∪ B is a set, and it has the same elements as A and B, but it is not the same set as A, because A has more elements.

### Basic graph definitions
- A graph is directed or fully oriented if its arc directions are specified using u → v or u ← v.
- A graph is partially oriented if it contains at least one directed cycle.
- A chain graph is a partially directed graph that contains no directed cycle.
- A directed acyclic graph is a fully oriented chain graph that is commonly used as a graphical causal model.
- An edge u ∼ v is a covered edge if Pa(u) \ {v} = Pa(v) \ {u}.

### Interventions and verifying sets
- An intervention is atomic if |S| = 1 and bounded if |S| ≤ k for some k > 0
- Observational data is a special case where S = ∅
- The effect of interventions is formally captured by Pearl's docalculus [Pea09]
- We call any I ⊆ 2 V a intervention set: an intervention set is a set of interventions where each intervention corresponds to a subset of variables
- An ideal intervention on S ⊆ V in G induces an interventional graph G S where all incoming arcs to vertices v ∈ S are removed [EGS12]
- It is known that intervening on S allows us to infer the edge orientation of any edge cut by S and V \S [Ebe07, HEH13, HLV14, SKDV15, KDV17]
- For ideal interventions, an I-essential graph E I (G) of G is the essential graph representing the Markov equivalence class of graphs whose interventional graphs for each intervention is Markov equivalent to G S for any intervention S ∈ I
- There are several known properties about I-essential graph properties [HB12, HB14]: Every I-essential graph is a chain graph with chordal6 chain components. This includes the case of S = ∅. Orientations in one chain component do not affect orientations in other components. In other words, to fully orient any essential graph E(G * ), it is necessary and sufficient to orient every chain component in E(G * ).
- A verifying set I for a DAG G ∈ [G * ] is an intervention set that fully orients G from E(G * ), possibly with repeated applications of Meek rules (see Appendix A).
- In other words, for any graph G = (V, E) and any verifying set I of G, we have E I (G) [V ] = G [V ] for any subset of vertices V ⊆ V . Furthermore, if I is a verifying set for G, then I ∪ S is also a verifying set for G for any additional intervention S ⊆ V .
- An subset verifying set I for a subset of target edges T ⊆ E in a DAG G ∈ [G * ] is an intervention set that fully orients all arcs in T given E(G * ), possibly with repeated applications of Meek rules.
- Note that the subset verifying set depends on the target edges and the underlying ground truth DAG -the subset verifying set for the same T ⊆ E may differ across two different DAGs G, G ∈ [G * ] in the same Markov equivalence class.

### Hasse diagrams
- A poset is a set with a special structure that allows for efficient computation of its Hasse diagram.
- Any DAG can be represented by a directed Hasse diagram.
- The Hasse diagram of a DAG can have multiple roots.

### Related work
- Section 1: The most relevant prior work to ours is [CSB22] where they studied the problems of verification and search under the special case of T = E.
- Other related works using non-atomic interventions include: [HLV14] showed that G * can be identified using O(log(log(n))) unbounded randomized interventions in expectation; [SKDV15] showed that O( n k log(log(k))) bounded sized interventions suffices.
- Other related works in the setting of additive vertex costs include: [GSKB18] studied the problem of maximizing the number of oriented edges given a budget of atomic interventions; [KDV17,LKDV18] studied the problem of finding a minimum cost (bounded size) intervention set to identify G * ; [LKDV18] showed that computing the minimum cost intervention set is NP-hard and gave search algorithms with constant approximation factors.

### Sufficient to study DAGs without v-structures

### Hasse diagrams of DAGs without v-structures
- A DAG G = (V, E) is a single connected component without v-structures if and only if the Hasse diagram H G is a directed tree with a unique root vertex.
- Lemma 8 enables us to properly define the notion of rooted subtrees in a Hasse diagram.
- Definition 9 (Rooted subtree) tells us that any vertex in a DAG G with no v-structures has a rooted subtree.
- Lemma 11 states that the covered edges of a DAG G are a subset of the Hasse edges in H G .

### Subset verification on DAGs without v-structures with atomic interventions
- The atomic subset verification problem is equivalent to the problem of interval stabbing on a rooted tree
- For a DAG G without v-structures, let H G be its rooted Hasse tree
- For any rooted tree, If the graph is clear from context, we will drop the subscript G
- We say that a vertex z ∈ and that a subset S ⊆ V stabs [a, b] if S has a vertex that stabs it
- Interpreting Theorem 10 with respect to the definition of an interval, we see that every edge u → v can be associated with some interval As such, we can reduce the subset verification problem on DAGs without v-structures to the following problem
- Definition 12 (Interval stabbing problem on a rooted tree)
- Given a rooted tree G = (V, E) with root r ∈ V and a set J of intervals of the form [u, v], find a set The interval stabbing problem on a rooted tree can be viewed both as a special case of the set cover problem, and as a generalization of the interval stabbing problem on a line
- The former is NP-hard [Kar72], while the latter can be solved using a polynomial time greedy algorithm (e.g. see [Eri19, Chapter 4, Exercise 4])
- The next result shows that one can reduce the subset verification problem on DAGs without v-structures to the interval stabbing problem
- Lemma 13. Let G = (V, E) be a connected DAG without v-structures, H be the Hasse tree of G, and T ⊆ E be a subset of target edges. Then, there exists a set of intervals J ⊆ 2 V ×V such that any solution to minimum interval stabbing problem on (H, J ) is a solution to the minimum sized atomic subset verification set (G, T ).
- Section 3.1 tells us that we can ignore arc orientations due to v-structures, thus we can apply Theorem 10 and Lemma 13 to reduce the problem to an instance of interval stabbing on a rooted tree
- As Theorem 14 tells us that this can be solved efficiently, we obtain an efficient algorithm for the subset verification problem
- Theorem 14. There exists a polynomial time algorithm for solving the interval stabbing problem on a rooted tree
- Theorem 15. For any DAG G = (V, E) and subset of target edges T ⊆ E, there exists a polynomial time algorithm to compute the minimal sized atomic subset verifying set
- Interestingly, any instance of interval stabbing on a rooted tree can also be reduced in polynomial time to an instance of subset verification on DAGs without v-structures.
- Lemma 16. Let H be a rooted tree and J ⊆ 2 V ×V be a set of intervals. Then, there exists a connected DAG G = (V, E) without v-structures and a subset T ⊆ E of edges such that any solution to the minimum sized atomic subset verification set (G, T ) is a solution to minimum interval stabbing problem on (H, J ).

### Subset verification on DAGs without v-structures with bounded size interventions and additive costs
- The problem is studied in the setting of bounded size interventions, where each intervention involves at most k vertices, and additive vertex costs.
- The problem is solved by exploiting the fact that the covered edges were a forest, and thus bipartite, and constructing non-atomic interventions sets by grouping vertices from the minimum size atomic verification set.
- The optimal bounded size intervention set that minimizes Eq. (1) costs OP T + 2β.

### Subset search on DAGs without v-structures
- A vertex cover of the target edges is a trivial upper bound for atomic subset search
- One needs to perform that many number of atomic interventions asymptotically in the worst case when facing an adaptive adversary
- Lemma 20. Given a subset of target edges T ⊆ E, intervening on the vertices in a vertex cover of T one-by-one will fully orient all edges in T .
- Lemma 21. Fix any integer n ≥ 1. There exists a fully unoriented essential graph on 2n vertices a subset T ⊆ E on n edges such that the size of the minimum vertex cover of T is vc(T ) and any algorithm needs at least vc(T ) − 1 number atomic interventions to orient all the edges in T against an adaptive adversary that reveals arc directions consistent with a DAG
- Theorem 23. Fix an interventional essential graph E I (G * ) of an unknown underlying DAG G * and let H be an arbitrary node-induced subgraph. There exists an algorithm that runs in polynomial time and computes an atomic intervention set I in a deterministic and adaptive manner such that
- Theorem 24. Fix an interventional essential graph E I (G * ) of an unknown underlying DAG G * and let H be an arbitrary node-induced subgraph. There exists an algorithm that runs in polynomial time and computes a bounded size intervention set I , where each intervention involves at most k ≥ 1 nodes, in a deterministic and adaptive manner such that

## Experiments and implementation
- Experiments were conducted on synthetic graphs to study the effect of subset verification on the number of target edges
- The number of target edges decreases as the T decreases, but the number of interventions needed to be performed is not always a good indication of the number of target edges
- The number of "independent target edges" is a better indicator of the number of target edges.

### Experiment 2: Local causal graph discovery
- Existing full graph search algorithms are not tailored to recover directions of a given subset of edges.
- In Fig. 5, we show the number of interventions needed to orient all edges within a r-hop neighborhood of some randomly chosen target node v. We see that that node-induced subgraph search SubsetSearch uses less interventions than existing state-of-the-art full graph search algorithms, even when we terminate them as soon as all edges in T are oriented.

## Conclusion and discussion

## A Meek rules
- Meek rules are a set of 4 edge orientation rules that are sound and complete
- Given any edge orientation information, one can always repeatedly apply Meek rules till a fixed point to maximize the number of oriented arcs
- Definition 26 (Consistent extension) states that a set of arcs has a consistent DAG extension π for a graph G if there exists a permutation on the vertices such that (i) every edge {u, v} in G is oriented u → v whenever π(u) < π(v), (ii) there is no directed cycle, (iii) all the given arcs are present
- Definition 27 (The four Meek rules [Mee95a], see 6 for an illustration) states that we can also show a arc version of Lemma 28. Proof. Suppose u → v appears in the Meek rule that orients a → b. Observe that v ≤ Anc b in all cases.

## B Hasse diagrams and transitive reductions
- A partially ordered set (poset) is a set where the order is partial.
- The tuple (X, ≤) is a partially ordered set (poset) if the following three properties are satisfied: (1) Reflexivity: For all x ∈ X, x ≤ x; (2) Anti-symmetric: For all x, y ∈ X, if x ≤ y and y ≤ x, then x = y; (3) Transitivity: For all x, y, z ∈ X, if x ≤ y and y ≤ z, then x ≤ z.
- A directed Hasse diagram is a graph where each element in X is a vertex and there is an arc y → x whenever y covers x for any two elements x, y ∈ X.
- A transitive reduction is a directed graph with minimum sized |E | such that there is a directed path from u to v in G if and only if there is a directed path from u to v in G t for any u, v ∈ V.
- Lemma 4 states that for any DAG G = (V, E) and any two intervention sets I 1 and I 2 , there is a directed path from u to v in G if and only if there is a directed path from u to v in G t for any u, v ∈ V.

### D.2 Hasse diagrams of DAGs without v-structures
- Lemma 8: A DAG G = (V, E) is a single connected component without v-structures if and only if the Hasse diagram H G is a directed tree with a unique root vertex.
- Direction 1: If DAG G is a single connected component without v-structures, then the Hasse diagram H G is a directed tree with a unique root vertex.
- Suppose, for a contradiction, that there are two distinct paths P 1 = (u, . . . , u , x) and Suppose, for a contradiction, that the DAG G has a v-structure u → x ← v.
- Since u, v ∈ Anc(x) and reachability is preserved in Hasse diagrams, there will be paths P 1 = (u, . . . , u , x) and P 2 (v, . . . , v , x) in H G .
- Since H G has a unique root, u and v must have a common ancestor y in H G (y could be the root itself).
- Contradiction. Clearly, R 1 (w) ∩ B(T y ) = ∅ since neither endpoint lies in T y .
- By Lemma 35 and Corollary 37, we know that R 2 (w) ∩ B(T y ) ⊆ R 1 (G, y). Thus, it suffices to argue that R 3 (w) ∩ B(T y ) ⊆ R 1 (G, y).
- To do so, consider an arbitrary (non-unique) ordering σ on the arcs in R 3 (w) ∩ B(T y ) by which Meek rule orients them: σ(a → b) < σ(c → d) means that the arc a → b was oriented before c → d.
- Suppose, for a contradiction, that there exists some arc in (R 3 (w) ∩ B(T y )) \ R(y). Let a → b ∈ (R 3 (w) ∩ B(T y )) \ R(y) be the arc with the minimal σ ordering, where a, b ∈ Des[y].
- We check the four Meek rule configurations that could have oriented a → b while using some arc orientation that is not in R 1 (G, y).
- If the oriented arc in the configuration belongs to R 3 (w), then it must be arc with lower σ ordering than a → b and is oriented in R 1 (G, y) by assumption.
- Meanwhile, observe that any arc in R 1 (w) ∪ R 2 (w) has Anc[w] as the start of the arc.
- In the configurations of Meek rule R1 and R2, if any of the oriented arcs belong to R 1 (w) ∪ R 2 (w), then a → b ∈ B(T y ) since a ∈ Anc [w]. So, it suffices to check only Meek rules R3 and R4: Since we always conclude that a → b ∈ R 1 (G, y), this is a contradiction.
- Theorem 10: Let G = (V, E) be a DAG without v-structures and u → v be an unoriented arc in E(G).
- Then, for an arbitrary consistent topological ordering π, let {π(z)} be the "furthest" ancestor vertex of u that orients u → v.
- By Lemma 38, Des(w .
- By minimality of w and Lemma 39, Anc(w Putting everything together, we see that Lemma 11. If G be a DAG without v-structures, then the covered edges of G are a subset of the Hasse edges in H G .

### D.3 Subset verification with atomic interventions

## E Efficient dynamic programming implementation of recurrence
- Definition 12: A set of intervals is said to intersect if there exists a vertex in the set that is also in the set.
- I v includes all the intervals in J that intersect with the subtree T v (i.e. has some vertex in V (T v ))
- I y ⊆ I v for any y ∈ Des(v)
- For any subset U ⊆ J and vertex v ∈ V , opt(U, v) denotes the size of the optimum solution to stab all the intervals in U using only vertices in V (T v ) in the subtree T v rooted at v, where That is, we must pick v ∈ I whenever E v = ∅, while α v and β v correspond to the decisions of picking v into the output and ignoring v from the output respectively.
- opt(J , r) is the optimum solution size to the interval stabbing problem, where r as the root of the given rooted tree.

### E.2 Efficient implementation
- Naively computing the recurrence relation of Eq. (2) will incur an exponential blow-up in state space.
- Instead, we will define an ordering ≺ on J so that our state space is over the indices of a sorted array instead of a subset of intervals (see Eq. ( 3)), so that we can implement the recurrence as a polynomial time dynamic programming (DP) problem.
- Our ≺ ordering relies on the Euler tree data structure for rooted trees [TV84, HK95], which computes a sequence τ of vertices visited in a depth-first search (DFS) from the root.
- Using this sequence τ , we can obtain the first (f ) and last ( ) times that a vertex is visited.
- More formally, we can define the mappings τ : {1, . . . , 2n − 1} → V , f : V → {1, . . . , 2n − 1}, and : V → {1, . . . , 2n − 1}. These mappings can be computed in linear time (via DFS) and f (v) ≤ (v) with equality only if v is a leaf of the tree.
- Lemma 49 (Properties of Euler tour data structure) tells us that the removal of superset intervals will not affect the optimality of the solution because stabbing intervals does not change the first or last time a vertex is visited.
- Lemma 52 (Properties of J with respect to ≺) guarantees that unstabbed intervals form a contiguous interval in J v and that E v appears first within J v .
- Lemma 53 (Euler tour data structure: existence and uniqueness of a minimum size subset verifying set) states that for any subset verifying set I, there exists a minimum size subset verifying set I′ such that I′ ⊆ I and every edge in I′ is oriented in E I (G).
- Algorithm 2 and Algorithm 3 of the paper's main body are two different implementations of the DP algorithm that always recurse on subsets within I v (e.g. see line 6 in Algorithm 3).
- For any vertex v ∈ V , our DP state will recurse on the smallest index of the remaining unstabbed intervals within I v .
- Suppose we are currently recursing on vertex v and index i. Let U = {[a, b] ∈ I v : J −1 ([a, b]) ≥ i}.
- To determine whether U ∩ E v is empty, we can define and check whether e v ≥ i. This works because Lemma 52 guarantees that E v appears in the front of J v , so e v ≥ i ⇐⇒ U ∩ E v = ∅.
- Meanwhile, the appropriate index update for U ∩ B y in the α v case is max{a y , i} where Minimum size/cost subset verifying set).
- Let w be a weight function on intervention sets. An intervention set I is called a subset verifying set for a subset of target edges T ⊆ E in a DAG G * if all edges in T are oriented in E I (G * ).
- In the special case of T = E, we have E I (G * ) = G * . I is a minimum size (resp. cost) subset verifying set if some edge in T remains unoriented in E I (G * ) for any |I | < |I| (resp. for any w(I ) < w(I)).
- While restricting to interventions of size at most k, the minimum verification number ν k (G, T ) denotes the size of the minimum size subset verifying set for any DAG G ∈ [G * ] and subset of target edges T ⊆ E. That is, any revealed arc directions when performing interventions on E(G * ) respects G.

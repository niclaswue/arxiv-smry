# Abstract
- Atomic partial charges are important for molecular dynamics simulations.
- Traditionally, partial charges are assigned using quantum chemical methods.
- A hybrid physical/graph neural network-based approach is proposed to approximate the widely popular AM1-BCC charge model.
- This hybrid approach is orders of magnitude faster and maintains accuracy comparable to differences in AM1-BCC implementations.
- The hybrid approach scales linearly with the number of atoms.
- Source code is available at a specified URL.

## Theory: espaloma graph neural networks for chemical environment perception, charge equilibration (qeq), and espalomacharge
- Espaloma uses graph neural networks to assign continuous latent representations of chemical environments to atoms
- GNNs are used to assign symmetry-preserving parameters for atomic, bond, angle, torsion, and improper force terms
- Initial features associated with nodes are determined based on resonance-independent atomic chemical features
- Message-passing step of GNN consists of edge update, neighborhood aggregation, and node update
- Hyperparameters are optimized during training to produce robust models
- Espaloma framework is used to predict atomic parameters
- Partial charges are predicted by predicting electronegativity and hardness of each atom
- Runtime complexity of EspalomaCharge is ( )

## Experiments: espalomacharge accurately reproduces am1-bcc charges at a fraction of its cost
- EspalomaCharge is comparable to or better than AmberTools and OpenEye in terms of charge RMSE
- EspalomaCharge is generalizable to other molecules of significance to chemical and biophysical modeling
- EspalomaCharge is most accurate where there is abundant data in the training set
- EspalomaCharge is 300 to 3000 times faster than AmberTools and 15 to 75 times faster than OpenEye
- EspalomaCharge has ( ) complexity and is capable of parameterizing peptides of a few hundred residues within seconds
- EspalomaCharge provides a seamless way to accelerate parameterization by distributing calculations on GPU hardware
- EspalomaCharge provides statistically indistinguishable performance compared to AmberTools and the OpenEye toolkit on both RMSE and R2 metrics

## Discussion
- EspalomaCharge assigns high-quality conformation-independent AM1-BCC charges
- Uses modern machine learning infrastructure
- Supports accelerated hardware
- Runtime complexity is ( ) with respect to number of atoms

- Future work could aim to reduce error for uncommon chemistries
- Incorporate ESP as a target in the training process
- Multi-objective strategy to include multiple targets and charge regularization terms

# Abstract
- Conscious states are both rich and ineffable.
- Explanatory gap: consciousness cannot be reduced to physical processes.
- Information theoretic dynamical systems perspective on richness and ineffability of consciousness.
- Richness of conscious experience corresponds to amount of information in conscious state.
- Ineffability corresponds to amount of information lost at different stages of processing.
- Attractor dynamics in working memory induce impoverished recollections of original experiences.
- Discrete symbolic nature of language is insufficient for describing rich and high-dimensional structure of experiences.
- Similarity in cognitive function of two individuals relates to improved communicability of their experiences to each other.

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Conscious states present apparent contradictions: they are both rich and ineffable.
- This paper provides an information theoretic dynamical systems perspective on why this is the case.
- Conscious experiences are derived from neural processes according to known physical laws.
- Illusionists argue that consciousness is an illusion, while realists deny this.
- The overflow debate is between those who hold that consciousness is rich and ineffable, and those who deny it.
- This paper proposes a formal description of how neural dynamics could give rise to the ordinary sense of richness and ineffability in the brain.
- Attractor dynamics in working memory would induce impoverished recollections of our original experiences.
- The discrete symbolic nature of language is insufficient for describing the rich and high-dimensional structure of experiences.
- Similarity in the cognitive function of two individuals relates to improved communicability of their experiences to each other.
- Shannon information theory and Kolmogorov complexity play a central role in making arguments precise.
- Various sources of ineffability in conscious experience are discussed.
- Implications of the model on the debate surrounding 'phenomenal' vs. 'access' consciousness are discussed.

## Preliminaries: computation through neural dynamics
- Neural activation space: a space in which temporally evolving states of neural activity follow trajectories
- Attractors: emergent properties of dynamical systems that allow neural networks to solve computational problems that require persistent memory

### Neural activation state space
- Brain activity can be quantified in several ways
- Brain activity can be represented as a vector in an N-dimensional state space
- Mathematical framework of dynamical systems theory can be used to reason about mental states
- Projecting the state onto lower-dimensional subspaces can reveal what a pattern of neural activity represents
- Probabilistic transition model can measure likelihood and information content of a state
- Similarities between states can be quantified according to some distance metric

### Neural dynamics
- Neural activity unfolds in time
- Recurrent loops form between neurons
- Activity of one neuron influences future activity of surrounding neurons
- Vector field illustrates how neural state transitions in the absence of noise
- Inputs warp vector field, resulting in different trajectories

### State attractors
- Neural dynamics often require persistent memory
- Dynamical systems can form regions in state space called "basins of attraction"
- Trajectories that enter these regions progress towards steady states
- Attractors can have complex and high-dimensional structure
- Attractors are mutually exclusive and can be identified with symbols
- Attractors can be used for efficient long-term memory
- Attractors can be modulated by external inputs
- Attractors have been used to explain neural computations
- Attractors have been observed empirically
- Attractors are mutually exclusive and create a partition of the state space
- Attractors have a dual discrete and continuous nature
- Introducing randomness in the dynamics can sample one of the attractors
- An RNN was trained to solve a 3-bit flip-flop task
- The RNN solved the task using fixed point attractors
- Each attractor corresponds to one of the 8 possible bit configurations
- Attractor dynamics can naturally emerge in neural networks to implement computations

## A dynamical systems model of conscious experience
- Dynamical systems model of consciousness with state attractors can account for communicable, rich, and ineffable aspects of experience
- Information theoretic perspective used to characterize richness as information, ineffability as information loss, and communicability as information retention
- Model links ineffability to Global Workspace Theory
- Multiple forms of information loss discussed in intra-personal and inter-personal communication pathways

### Motivating attractor dynamics as a model for conscious experience
- Working memory is typically considered to be the attended contents of short term memory
- Many theories of consciousness claim that what we are consciously aware of is the contents of working memory
- Global Workspace Theory states that information becomes conscious by gaining entry into a limited workspace
- Workspace serves as a hub for coordinating brain-wide activity
- Working memory and attractor dynamics are linked
- Attractor model for working memory postulates that working memory emerges from recurrently connected cortical neural networks
- Attractor dynamics can support suppression and integration of inputs
- Neural winner-take-all models implement hybrid analog-discrete computation
- Robustness, discreteness, and temporal integration of information are all traits apparent in working memory
- Attractor dynamics predict that our experience consists of a sequence of relatively stable states
- Conscious neural representations are more stable than unconscious ones
- Robustness to noise and reproducibility of states are core properties of attractor dynamics

### Richness and ineffability
- Notation is used to describe random variables, probability distributions, and expectations
- Richness of experience is having a lot of detail, texture, nuance, or informational content
- Ineffability is too great for words and is measured by information loss when trying to express a conscious state in words
- Effability is the negation of ineffability and is measured by the amount of shared information between two variables
- Shannon entropy measures the average number of bits needed to specify a value of a variable
- Kolmogorov complexity measures the information carried by an individual state independently of probability distributions
- Richness corresponds to Kolmogorov complexity and ineffability corresponds to conditional Kolmogorov complexity
- Shannon entropy and Kolmogorov complexity are closely related metrics of richness
- Shannon entropy has drawbacks for characterizing ineffability
- Kolmogorov complexity should be used to characterize richness and ineffability of experiences

### Intra-personal ineffability
- The functions f A φ, f S φ and f M φ are deterministic while f V φ and f X φ are generally stochastic.
- Entropy H φ is parameterized since it depends on p φ.
- The relation of time-varying states x to a smaller subset a of attractor states is a defining characteristic of attractor dynamics.
- The presence of attractors decreases the richness of transient states overall.
- Attractor states are strictly less rich than trajectory states.
- Selective release of attractor working memory states to downstream processing implements an information bottleneck that limits the richness of downstream inputs.
- Conscious experience is upper bounded by the richness of trajectories.
- Information loss from trajectory X to working memory output A is expected to be significantly large.
- Ineffability of experience is most obvious when attempting to put it into words.
- Information loss from attractor A or conscious experience S to verbal message M means the latter do not fully identify the former.
- Positive information loss H φ (S|M ) implies it is generally impossible to perfectly recover the conscious experience from the verbal message.
- Attractors can have more complex and high-dimensional structure than simple fixed points.
- The brain is hierarchical in nature with many levels of spatial and temporal organization.
- Attractor dynamics appear to be ubiquitous across organizational levels and cortical regions of the brain.
- The presence of multiple weakly coupled neocortical attractor networks yields benefits including specialization and increased memory capacity.

### Inter-personal ineffability
- Communication between two individuals is modeled using a speaker (Alice) and a listener (Bob).
- Alice's experience is communicated to Bob using a message m.
- Bob's experience is a function of Alice's cognitive parameters φ.
- Ineffability of Alice's experience given the message is K(s|m).
- Ineffability increases when Bob's cognitive parameters φ are not known.
- Ineffability of the attractor state is E p φ (a|m) K(a|m).
- Ineffability of the conscious experience is at least as great as the complexity of the working memory attractor.
- Ineffability of the conscious experience can only improve by conditioning on Bob's parameters.
- The mismatch between Alice and Bob's parameters corresponds to the difference between their cognitive functions.
- Inter-personal ineffability is greater when Alice and Bob are dissimilar.

### Phenomenal and access consciousness
- Information theoretic dynamical systems perspective on richness and ineffability
- Ambiguities in the meaning of access
- Three notions of effability, accessibility, and reportability
- Global Workspace Theory of consciousness
- Three classes of representations: unconscious, conscious, and accessible but not amplified
- Richness of transient states may be consciously experienced but not directly accessible or reportable
- Debate between adherents of Global Workspace Theory on whether items from third class are conscious
- Attendedness may be used to delineate conscious and unconscious
- Attractor model of working memory suggests second explanation for self-report of phenomenal experience
- Rich phenomenal experience exists and is reportable

# Abstract
- Drug combination therapy is a well-established strategy for disease treatment.
- Computational approaches, specifically deep learning models, can be used to discover synergistic combinations.
- Data from various datasets was collected and used to generate informative representations and features.
- A message-passing graph was built to propagate information and graph structure learning flexibility.
- State-of-the-art results were achieved in comparison with other deep learning-based methods.
- 10% improvement over previous methods was observed in a test on an independent set.
- Robust against unseen drugs and surpasses almost 15% AU ROC compared to the second-best model.

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Drug combination therapy has advantages such as improved efficacy, reduced side effects and host toxicity, and can overcome drug resistance
- Used to treat complex diseases such as HIV, virus infections, and cancer
- Combination of two drugs, CBS and NAC, suppresses SARS-CoV-2 virus and reduces viral loads
- Traditional methods for drug combination discovery are time-consuming and costly
- High-throughput drug screening (HTS) is a sensitive and fast synchronous experiment
- Public databases provide antifungal drug combinations data and a large HTS synergy study
- In vivo and in vitro experiments are not always consistent
- Machine learning models and neural networks are effective and promising in finding novel drug combinations
- Deep learning models and traditional machine learning models are used to compare and evaluate drug combinations

## Methodology
- Preprocessing section: datasets manipulation and feature pre-training
- Heterogeneous graph section: graph construction, graph neural network, and synergistic prediction head information
- Graph structure learning section: Drug-Target predictive module, Drug-Drug interaction module, and graph structure learning details
- Self-training and inference section: self-training strategy and inference

### Preprocessing
- We use multiple datasets to meet our requirements
- Zinc250k/ChemBL used for unsupervised training
- PrimeKG integrates 20 high-quality datasets
- Therapeutics Data Commons is a resource platform
- DrugComb is an open-access data portal
- AstraZeneca is an independent dataset
- Drug data unified by DrugBankID or ChemBLID
- Protein data aligned via Gene ID, Uniprot ID, and Protein ID
- Cell line data originally expressed on 13418 proteins
- Features of drug, protein, and disease obtained from three pre-trained models
- Protein: ESM-1b
- Drug: KPGT
- Disease: RotatE
- Cell line: Depmap CCLE

### Heterogeneous graph
- Constructed a heterogeneous graph with nine edge types and three node types
- Drug-Drug Similarity edge computed by measuring distance between KPGT drug embeddings and fingerprints Tanimoto similarity
- Graph neural networks built upon constructed graph to conduct message passing
- MLP modules used to form unified vectors with length 512
- Graph attention network used to propagate information
- Synergistic Prediction Head used to extract final drug representations and cell line representations

### Graph structure learning
- Graph Structure Learning (GSL) is a technique for learning adaptive graphs when only limited data is available.
- GSL is used to generate pseudo edges to conduct inductive inference for unseen drugs.
- Drug-Target Interaction (DTI) and Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) are the two most informative edge types for unseen drugs.
- DTI and DDI modules are pre-trained separately and fine-tuned into the framework.
- Refined graph is passed through a graph neural network and enters a synergistic prediction head.
- Framework is tuned according to a binary cross entropy function.

### Self-training and inference
- Self-training can be used to improve limited-data supervised learning tasks.
- There are over 0.7 billion possible cases in the combinatorial search space, but only 0.1% of the space is labeled data.
- A new training set is created by merging the original dataset with entries whose confidence scores are greater than 0.8.
- The model is retrained until it cannot gain improvement.

## Results
- Model is a fully differentiable end-to-end method to predict drug synergistic combinations from drug sequences and cell line representation
- Techniques used include large-scale pre-training, adaptive self-training, and prediction module
- Evaluated model against state-of-the-art methods on DrugComb dataset
- Model achieved best result across all metrics except for ACC and precision
- Model outperformed DeepDDS by around 2% and classical ml methods by almost 20%
- Model achieved highest prediction score and DeepDDs/MR-GNN achieved similar second-best values
- Evaluated model on AstraZeneca dataset, model achieved highest result across all metrics
- Model outperformed DeepDDS by around 14%
- Evaluated model on independent drugs and cell lines, model achieved high AU ROC and AU PRC over 80%
- Ablation study conducted to evaluate effectiveness of submodules

## Conclusion
- Developed an end-to-end model to detect drug combinations
- Model outperforms counterparts
- Model can handle novel drugs
- Future research direction is to develop a multi-task method
- Incorporating 3D molecular structure into framework to improve performance
- Supported by Research Grants Council of Hong Kong

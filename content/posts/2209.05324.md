## Evaluation metrics
- LET-3D-APL is a metric used in camera-only 3D detection instead of 3D-AP.
- LET-3D-APL penalizes longitudinal localization errors by scaling precision using localization affinity.
- mAP is similar to AP metric in 2D object detection, but matching strategy is replaced with 2D center distance on BEV plane.

## Nds.
- NDS is a combination of several metrics
- NDS is computed by using the weightsum of the metrics, with mAP having a weight of 5 and the rest having a weight of 1

## Methodology of bev perception
- BEV perception is divided into three settings based on input modality
- Tab. 2 summarizes the taxonomy of BEV perception literature

- BEV-based methods and perspective methods are two different ways to reconstruct 3D information from 2D images

## Bev lidar

## Pre-bev feature extraction
- Point-based methods process raw point cloud, voxel-based methods voxelize points into grids
- 3D convolution or 3D sparse convolution used to extract point cloud features
- Features of each point calculated by linear layer, batch normalization, and activation function

- PointPillars and its variants have high efficiency and are suitable for industrial applications

## Discussion
- Images and point clouds are in different coordinate systems.
- Point clouds can be projected onto image coordinates, but the sparse nature of point clouds makes it difficult to extract features.
- Images in perspective view can be transformed into 3D space, but lack of depth information makes it an ill-posed problem.
- BEV provides a unified representation for multisensor and temporal fusion.
- Ego-motion information can be used to compensate for temporal fusion in BEV space.

## Bev fusion

## Lidar-camera fusion

- BEV-Fusion [91] encodes camera and lidar features into same BEV to ensure independence
- UVTR [121] represents input modalities in modal-specific voxel spaces and conducts cross-modality interaction

## Temporal fusion
- Temporal information is important for recognizing objects and occlusions.
- BEV provides a connection between scene representations in different timestamps.
- Works use ego-motion to align previous BEV features to current coordinates.
- Attention module is used to fuse temporal information from previous BEV feature maps and frames.
- Ego-motion information is used to correct locations for the attention module.

## Industrial design of bev perception

## Empirical evaluation and recipe
- Bag of tricks and useful practices can be used to achieve top results on various benchmarks.
- BEVFormer++ and Voxel-SPVCNN are two examples of this.

## Data augmentation

## Bev camera (camera-only) detection
- Common data augmentations used for 2D recognition tasks can be applied to camera based BEV perception.
- Augmentations can be divided into static (color variation) and spatial (moving pixels).
- Common augmentations used in recent work include color jitter, flip, multi-scale resize, rotation, crop and grid mask.
- BEVFormer++ uses color jitter, flip, multi-scale resize and grid mask.
- Images can be flipped in two ways: flipping image, ground truth and camera parameters, or flipping the whole 3D space symmetrically.
- Data augmentation is important for improving 3D model performance.

## Lidar segmentaion
- Data augmentation can be used in segmentation tasks, including random rotation, scaling, flipping, and point translation
- Painting can be used to enhance point cloud data with image information

- DETR decoder is used with Smooth L1 loss, FreeAnchor and Center-Point are also used
- Ablation study shows different heads perform differently under various settings

## Test-time augmentation (tta)

## Bev camera-only detection
- BEV detection removes the burden of multi-camera object level fusion.
- Duplicate features are likely to be sampled on different BEV locations along a light ray to camera center.
- Leveraging 2D detection results for duplicate removal on 3D detection results can improve 3D detection performance.

## Lidar segmentation
- Most misclassification occurs within similar classes
- Post-processing techniques can improve mIoU
- Existing segmentation methods do not consider consistency of single object
- Object-level refinement is conducted to improve object-level integrity

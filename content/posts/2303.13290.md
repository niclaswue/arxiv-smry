# Abstract
- Deep point cloud registration methods have difficulty with partial overlaps and require labeled data.
- UDPReg is an unsupervised deep probabilistic registration framework for point clouds with partial overlaps.
- Network learns posterior probability distributions of Gaussian mixture models from point clouds.
- Sinkhorn algorithm predicts distribution-level correspondences under the constraint of the mixing weights of GMMs.
- Three distribution consistency-based losses: self-consistency, cross-consistency, and local contrastive.
- UDPReg achieves competitive performance on 3DMatch/3DLoMatch and ModelNet/ModelLoNet benchmarks.

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Rigid point cloud registration aims to align two partially overlapping point clouds.
- Used in robotics, augmented reality, autonomous driving, and radiotherapy.
- Recent advances are dominated by learning-based approaches.
- Two categories of deep learning-based point cloud registration methods: correspondence-free and correspondence-based.
- Unsupervised deep probabilistic registration framework proposed to alleviate limitations.
- Sinkhorn algorithm used to predict distribution-level correspondences.
- Self-consistency, cross-consistency, and local-contrastive losses formulated.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on a comprehensive set of experiments.

## Related work
- Point-level registration approaches extract point-wise features and establish point-to-point correspondences
- Numerous works focus on extracting discriminative features for geometric correspondences
- Networks are used to generate soft correspondences from local features and to estimate inliers
- Keypoint-free methods downsample the point clouds into super-points and match them by examining neighborhoods
- Distribution-level methods model point clouds as probability distributions and perform alignment by correlation-based or EM-based optimization
- Unsupervised point cloud registration uses autoencoders or contrastive learning with data augmentation
- Proposed method uses distribution-level loss and does not require data augmentation

## Method

### Problem formulation
- Point cloud registration seeks to align two point clouds
- Point clouds contain 3D points
- Transformation consists of rotation and translation
- Distribution-to-distribution approach is used to fit point clouds
- Goal is to learn GMMs of point clouds without ground-truth labels
- Network extracts point-wise features and overlap scores
- Cluster-level and point-level matching is used to estimate correspondences
- RANSAC is used to calculate transformation
- Network is trained in an unsupervised manner

### The proposed gmm-based registration
- Feature extraction is used to downsample raw point clouds and extract associated features.
- A method is proposed to learn the joint distribution over the spatial coordinate and feature spaces.
- GMMs are calculated in 3D coordinate space and feature space.
- Cluster-level matching is used to generate probability matrices and soft assignments.
- Outliers are dealt with by adding a Gaussian kernel density.
- Point-level registration is used to extract point correspondences and estimate the transformation.
- RANSAC is used to take the point correspondence set as an input.

### Consistency-based unsupervised learning
- Self-consistency loss encourages point clouds to share an identical posterior distribution in coordinate and feature spaces.
- Cross-consistency loss encourages the network to learn transformation-invariant feature representations.
- Local contrastive loss models the local information of the point cloud.
- Self-consistency, cross-consistency and local contrastive losses are combined.
- Correspondence or pose between two partially overlapping point clouds is unknown in training.
- Maximizing log-likelihood of samples to Θs and Θt.
- Minimizing cross-entropy loss between γ and predictions S.

## Experiments
- Conducted experiments to evaluate performance of method
- Used real datasets 3DMatch and 3DLoMatch
- Used synthetic datasets ModelNet and ModelLoNet

### Implementation details
- Implemented in PyTorch
- Trained on one GPU and two CPUs
- Used AdamW optimizer with initial learning rate of 1e-4 and weight decay of 1e-6
- Adopted similar encoder and decoder architectures from [38]
- Trained for 200 epochs on 3DMatch with batch size of 1, halving learning rate every 70 epochs
- Trained for 400 epochs on ModelNet with batch size of 1, halving learning rate every 100 epochs
- Set L=128 and K=64 for 3DMatch and 3DLoMatch, L=64 and K=32 for ModelNet and Model-LoNet
- Cluster head MLP consists of 3 fully connected layers with LeakyReLU activation except for final layer

### Evaluation on 3dmatch and 3dlomatch
- 3DMatch and 3DLoMatch are two widely used indoor datasets
- 46 scenes used for training, 8 for validation, 8 for testing
- Test set contains 1,623 partially overlapping point cloud fragments
- Training data preprocessed and evaluated with both 3DMatch and 3DLoMatch protocols
- Training data augmentation by applying small rigid perturbations, jittering point locations, and shuffling points
- Baselines include supervised and unsupervised methods
- UDPReg outperforms all unsupervised methods and achieves lowest average rotation and translation errors
- UDPReg exceeds some supervised methods and achieves competitive results

### Evaluation on modelnet40
- ModelNet40 contains 12,311 meshed CAD models from 40 categories
- Point clouds are sampled from ModelNet40 with 1,024 points and cropped and sub-sampled into two partial overlap settings
- Performance is measured using Relative Rotation Error (RRE), Relative Translation Error (RTE) and Chamfer distance (CD)
- Baselines include supervised SOTA methods, unsupervised method, traditional methods and probabilistic methods
- UDPReg outperforms all previous methods regarding rotation and translation criteria
- Loss functions used are local contrastive loss (LC), cross consistency loss (CC), and self-consistency loss (SC)
- Number of clusters has little influence as long as there are "enough"
- UDPReg extracts hierarchical correspondences from clusters to points
- Point-level matching is beneficial for registration
- Hierarchical registration strategy is more effective than directly predicting point-level correspondences

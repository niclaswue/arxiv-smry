# Abstract
- Recent advances in 3D scene representation and novel view synthesis have led to the development of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs).
- Photorealistic 3D scene stylization is a task that aims to generate visually consistent and photorealistic stylized scenes from novel views.
- A new learning framework called LipRF has been developed to upgrade arbitrary 2D PST methods with Lipschitz mapping tailored for the 3D scene.
- LipRF uses an adaptive regularization to balance the reconstruction and stylization, and a gradual gradient aggregation strategy to optimize it in a cost-efficient manner.

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Photorealistic style transfer (PST) is a task for visual content creation
- Deep learning has been used to develop sophisticated deep PST methods
- 3D scene representation has featured Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)
- Photorealistic 3D scene stylization is a more challenging task
- Task is to generate visually consistent and photorealistic stylized syntheses from arbitrary views
- Difficulty originates from no valid photorealistic style loss tailored for training NeRF
- Task is simplified as a problem to regulate the volume rendering variance of the radiance field before and after stylization
- Linear mappings of image pixels can preserve the image structures with photorealistic effect
- Proposed LipRF framework for photorealistic 3D scene stylization
- Contains two stages: training a radiance field and learning a Lipschitz network
- Contributions: analysis of photorealistic 3D scene stylization, LipRF framework, adaptive regularization and gradual gradient aggregation

### Novel view synthesis
- Novel view synthesis is a technique to create view images with different camera poses from source images.
- Different discrete representations have been used, such as multi-plane images, point clouds, meshes, and voxels.
- Neural radiance field approaches encode the scene into a continuous implicit volumetric representation.
- Plenoxels simplifies NeRF into a sparse voxel grid with spherical harmonics to achieve speedups with comparable rendering quality.
- Our work enables photorealistic 3D scene stylization in a few minutes.

### Style transfer methods
- Photorealistic style transfer has been a topic of interest for a long time
- Neural networks are used to transfer artistic texture
- Semantic masks and photorealistic regularization are used to produce impressive results
- High frequency is preserved to ensure photorealism
- Particular style transfer operators are used with Encoder-Decoder pre-trained on natural image datasets
- Edge-preserved local affine grid is used to transfer color locally
- Several works couple NeRF with neural style transfer to tackle artistic 3D scene stylization

### Lipschitz network
- Neural networks with a limited Lipschitz constant have advantages in robustness, generalization, and stability of training.
- Computing the exact Lipschitz constant of neural networks is difficult.
- Previous methods usually minimize or specify an upper bound of Lipschitz constant as a small value.
- This small Lipschitz constant limits the visual effect in synthesis tasks.
- We propose to adaptively constrain Lipschitz property according to the given scene and reference image.

## Preliminaries
- Radiance field is a 5D function that maps 3D location and viewing direction to volume density and color.
- Appearance part of radiance field can be factorized using spherical harmonic representation.
- Volume rendering estimates color of ray with near and far bounds.
- Lipschitz functions are defined as having a Lipschitz constant K that satisfies a certain equation.

## Problem statement
- Goal is to synthesize novel photorealistic views with similar color style to reference image
- Challenge is to preserve photorealism and consistency while transferring color style
- Reinterpret pixels from perspective of rays
- Core challenge is to learn a stylized radiance field

## Methodology
- Introduces LipRF framework to tackle photorealistic 3D scene stylization
- Transforms pre-trained radiance field with Lipschitz MLP to reconstruct views stylized by 2D PST
- Gradual gradient aggregation to optimize LipRF in cost-efficient way

### Scene representation via radiance field
- A radiance field F is trained to reconstruct a real scene I
- Reconstruction loss is used for training
- Rays are generated under given camera parameters
- Color is estimated by volume rendering
- Geometry of I is assumed to be fully encoded by F geo
- F geo is set to F' geo to ensure same rendering weights

### Theoretic form of stylized radiance field
- Classic 2D PST methods transfer color style by linear mappings of pixels
- Lipschitz constants of these methods are usually less than 5
- Lipschitz property may play an important role in maintaining image structure
- Propose to mitigate limited expressivity of linear mapping while maintaining Lipschitz condition

### Lipschitz transformation of radiance field
- LipRF is a computer science paper
- LipRF has two steps: transforming the radiance field and training the objective
- The training objective is to reconstruct the scene and adjust the Lipschitz constant of the network
- To determine the optimal Lipschitz constant, a color transfer method is used to compute the transfer matrix between two images
- Adaptive Lipschitz regularization is used to optimize the Lipschitz constant of the network

### Optimization by gradual gradient aggregation
- Plenoxels [67] require transformation of spherical harmonic coefficients on all vertices at each iteration.
- Optimizing a sparse set of rays [8,47] at once causes redundancy.
- Gradual gradient aggregation (GGA) proposed to increase training efficiency.
- GGA does not construct computation graphs during forward process to reduce memory footprint.
- GGA gradually propagates gradient after redoing each forward step.
- Gradient of Lipschitz MLP aggregated in batch-wise way.
- GGA enables fast training speed and tractable memory footprint.

## Experiments
- LipRF architecture is based on Plenoxels2
- MLP has 5 linear-activation layers and 1 linear output layer
- Adam optimizer used, learning rate reduced from 10-2 to 10-4
- Evaluated on NeRF-synthetic, LLFF, Tanks and Temples, and DTU datasets
- Style images from PST dataset
- Baselines: MKL, WCT 2, CCPL, UPST

### Qualitative results
- LipRF integrates advantages of radiance field with MKL
- Radiance field encourages rendered colors to be consistent with source scene background
- 2D PST methods have two main downsides: noises and blurred results
- LipRF eliminates limitations of 2D PST methods and obtains high-quality stylized results
- LipRF alleviates issues of inaccurate object masks and provides consistent results

### Quantitative results
- Temporal consistency is used to evaluate cross-view consistency
- LipRF is the only method that performs better than linear method MKL
- LipRF improves 2D PST to adapt for 3D scenes
- User study shows LipRF has 79% preference over UPST and MKL

### Ablation study
- Activation is essential for constructing Lipschitz networks
- Sigmoid and Tanh do not work due to vanishing gradients
- Sine-based LipRF can obtain more faithful color style
- Lipschitz regularization impacts LipRF
- Removing regularization creates noisy details and increases Lipschitz constant
- Lower Lipschitz constant leads to weaker color change and smoother image

## Conclusion
- Novel framework proposed to tackle photorealistic 3D scene stylization
- Challenge is to preserve photorealism and consistency during stylization
- Two objectives simplified into maintaining volume rendering variance
- Lipschitz MLP enables controlling variance
- Adaptive regularization to constrain lower bound of Lipschitz constant

# Abstract
- Computer vision can help ecologists speed up their research by automating the analysis of raw imagery from sensors
- The workshop discussed best practices for teaching computer vision to ecologists, which may be useful to other domain experts who are learning to use computer vision
- This document is intended for computer scientists who teach computer vision across disciplines, but it may also be useful to ecologists or other domain experts who are learning to use computer vision

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Computer vision algorithms can automate the process of extracting important information from images and videos
- This is especially important when manually reviewing the data is not feasible
- Ecology presents a particularly compelling use case for computer vision
- We must equip ecologists with the skills they need to understand and apply computer vision methods in their research
- While ecologists often have training in statistics and programming, they are rarely exposed to the interconnected web of software engineering and machine learning topics necessary for computer vision

## Related Work
- Machine learning is an emerging literature devoted to teaching how to make computers do things that they've never done before
- Most of these works concern efforts to teach students from computer science or related disciplines
- However, there is prior work discussing the specific challenge of teaching machine learning to cross-disciplinary audiences
- Our work is complementary, focusing on the process of teaching computer vision to ecologists who have background knowledge in statistics and programming but little prior experience in machine learning
- In addition, we consider an immersive workshop in which researchers build prototypes using their own research data, not a traditional classroom environment

## The CV4E Workshop
- The inaugural CV4E Workshop was held at Caltech from August 1 -19, 2022
- The program was designed to train ecologists to use computer vision in their own research
- Application had five components: (i) a one-page project proposal, (ii) a one-page personal statement, (iii) a programming example, (iv) one letter of reference, and (v) a CV
- The selection process was based on the candidate's goal clarity, project feasibility, potential impact, and preparation
- All 18 of the workshop's participants had trained models by the end of the workshop
- The workshop's community has persisted beyond the workshop through the Slack workspace

## Lessons Learned
- Participants struggled with insufficient Python preparation
- In the future, we will enforce more structured Python preparation before the workshop
- It is challenging to build a working computer vision system from scratch in 3 weeks
- To maximize the probability of success, it is important to start simple
- When appropriate, we encouraged participants to use standard well-understood pipelines
- Collect similar projects in working groups
- Mix experience levels in working groups
- Avoid deep learning library wrappers
- Make sure GPUs are available

## Educational Techniques
- Guided troubleshooting was important to provide opportunities to hone these abilities.
- To balance these objectives, instructors tried to walk participants through the troubleshooting process by asking leading questions about the problems they were encountering.
- For unusual problems of limited educational value (i.e. complex configuration or installation issues), instructors intervened to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.
- Pair pseudocoding was used to prevent participants from getting stuck on code design issues.
- Contextualized lectures were used to ensure that the lectures remained grounded in applications and examples.

## Conclusion
- The inaugural CV4E Workshop had 18 participants.
- Broken down by current occupation, our cohort consisted of:
- 1 Master's student;
- 10 Ph.D. students;
- 5 post-doctoral researchers; and
- 2 researchers from government agencies or nongovernmental organizations.
- Broken down geographically, our cohort consisted of:
- 11 participants from 7 different states in the U.S.;
- 5 participants from European countries; and
- 2 participants from Canada.
- Participants came from diverse academic backgrounds, including conservation biology, biological anthropology, geography, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, neuroscience, and ecology.
- Projects fell into seven main categories.
- 4) use detection as an intermediate step towards counting.
- 5. Segmentation: Classifying pixels based on their semantic characteristics.
- The three relevant projects were segmenting: (1) walrus groups in the Arctic, (2) permafrost, and (3) trees.
- All projects were based on remote sensing imagery.
- 6. Clustering: Grouping objects together according to some notion of similarity.
- The one relevant project was: (1) determining the species richness of an area using the number of clusters in a collection of camera trap imagery.
- 7. Super-resolution: Increasing the resolution of an image.
- The one relevant project was: (1) increasing the resolution of land surface temperature data using satellite imagery.
- In this section we catalog topics that many of our participants learned during the workshop, either through formal instruction or on their own.
- See also the list of lectures in Appendix C.

# Abstract
- Computer vision can automate the analysis of raw imagery from sensors.
- Computer vision is rarely taught to ecologists.
- This paper discusses the experience of teaching a diverse group of ecologists to prototype and evaluate computer vision systems in a summer workshop.

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Manual annotation of images and videos is time consuming
- Computer vision algorithms can automate this process
- Computer vision is important for ecology due to climate change
- Ecologists need to understand and apply computer vision methods

## Related work
- Teaching machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision to computer science students
- Teaching machine learning to cross-disciplinary audiences such as non-CS undergraduates, business students, artists, materials scientists, and biologists
- Teaching computer vision to ecologists with background knowledge in statistics and programming
- Workshop in which researchers build prototypes using their own research data, not a traditional classroom environment

## The cv4e workshop
- CV4E Workshop held at Caltech from August 1-19, 2022
- Program designed to train ecologists to use computer vision
- Application process included project proposal, personal statement, programming example, letter of reference, and CV
- Selection process included reviews from machine learning and ecology communities
- All participants funded for travel, room, and board
- Participants met with instructors to finalize project plans and learn Python
- Lectures, Invited Speakers, Reading Groups, Work Time, and Group Updates during workshop
- All 18 participants had trained models by end of workshop
- Slack workspace and ongoing projects formed community beyond workshop

## Lessons learned
- Enforce structured Python preparation before workshop
- Start simple when building computer vision system
- Collect similar projects in working groups
- Mix experience levels in working groups
- Make unambiguous infrastructure recommendations
- Avoid deep learning library wrappers
- Avoid Jupyter Notebooks
- Make sure GPUs are available

## Educational techniques
- Guided troubleshooting to hone machine learning skills
- Pair pseudocoding to help participants write code
- Goal statements to help participants track progress
- Contextualized lectures to keep topics grounded in applications

## Conclusion
- 18 participants in the inaugural 2022 CV4E Workshop
- 11 participants from 7 different states in the US, 5 from European countries, 2 from Canada
- Participants from diverse academic backgrounds
- 7 main categories of projects
- Using annotation tools to label image or audio data
- Common Unix commands
- Tools like nano, tmux, and screen
- SSH command and SSH keys
- Tools like scp or rsync for transferring files
- Using GitHub for tracking changes made to code
- Interacting with web interfaces of cloud computing providers
- Creating and managing virtual environments
- Libraries and command-line tools like OpenCV, ImageMagick, and FFmpeg
- Classes and objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism
- Common data structures and their methods
- Mutable and immutable objects
- In-place operations
- Concept of generalization
- Errors vs. warnings
- Types of errors
- Simplified dependency graph of skills required to develop a computer vision system
- Reading documentation, finding code, understanding components of a codebase
- Recognizing markers of quality in open source code

# Abstract
- Humans can show sudden improvements in task performance linked to insight
- Artificial neural networks can also show insight-like behaviour
- Insight-like behaviour in neural networks is caused by noise, attentional gating and regularisation

# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Ability to learn from experience is common to animals and some artificial agents
- Neural networks trained with SGD are a current theory of human learning
- Humans may sometimes learn in an abrupt manner
- Insights occur when an agent finds a novel problem solution by restructuring an existing task representation
- Insights involve unconscious processes becoming conscious
- Insights can be accompanied by a feeling of relief or pleasure
- Insights are related to brain regions distinct from those associated with gradual learning
- Insight-like behaviour can emerge from gradual learning algorithms
- Insights trigger abrupt behavioural changes
- Insights occur selectively in some subjects
- Insights occur "spontaneously" without external cues
- Regularisation and gating can cause discontinuities in learning in neural networks

## Results
- 99 participants and 99 neural networks performed a decision task
- Task required a binary choice about circular arrays of moving dots
- Dots were characterized by two features with different degrees of noise
- Task provided a hidden opportunity to improve one's decision strategy
- Initial training phase only motion direction predicted correct choice
- Later phase both features could be used to determine choice
- Post-experimental questionnaire asked if participants noticed a rule, how long it took, and if they paid attention to colour

### Human behaviour
- Participants learned the response mapping for the four motion directions well
- Noise was added to the motion, while the colour remained uncorrelated
- Performance was heavily diminished in the conditions with the largest amounts of motion noise
- Performance improvements largely beyond these low baseline levels can only be attributed to colour use
- Noise level continued to influence performance in the motion and colour phase
- Onset of the colour correlation triggered performance improvements across all coherence levels
- 57.6% of participants reported using colour, 42.4% indicated not to have noticed or used the colour
- Performance best fit by a non-linear sigmoid function, indicating at least a subsection of putative insight participants
- 48.5% of participants had values larger than the 100% percentile of the control distribution, suggesting abrupt insight occurred selectively
- 79.2% of insight participants self-reported to have used colour to make correct choices
- Insight subjects started to perform significantly better in the lowest coherence trials once the motion and colour phase started
- Reaction times reflected the same improvements upon switching to the colour strategy
- Insight moments were defined as the time points of inflection of the fitted sigmoid function
- Average delay of insight onset was 1.3 task blocks (130 trials)

### Neural network behaviour
- 99 network models were trained on a decision making task with two input nodes (colour and motion) and one output node
- Each input node was sampled from a normal distribution with a mean and standard deviation
- The network multiplied each input node by two parameters, a corresponding weight and a gate
- L1-regularisation was added to the gate weights to introduce competitive dynamics between the input channels
- The network was trained with online gradient descent with Gaussian white noise added to the gradient update and a fixed learning rate
- The network was trained in a curriculum matched to the human task
- The input sequences the networks received were sampled from the same ten input sequences that humans were exposed to
- The networks were given a slightly longer training phase than the humans
- L2-regularisation was also added to the gate weights to compare the effect of the aggressiveness of the regulariser
- Non-regularised networks showed no insight-like behaviour

### Origins of insight-like behaviour in neural networks
- Established behavioural similarity between L1-networks and humans in an insight task
- Investigated dynamics of gate weights and effects of noise in insight vs. no-insight networks
- Investigated role of regularisation strength parameter λ
- Colour gate weight gradients were significantly larger in insight compared to no-insight L1-networks
- Motion gate weight gradients did not differ
- Insight networks had larger colour gate weight gradients even before any behavioural changes were apparent
- Change point analysis confirmed the onset of the motion and colour phase to be the change point of the colour gradient mean
- Difference between insight and no-insight networks for colour gates around the individually fitted switch points
- Insight networks' increased use of colour inputs was particularly evident at the end of learning
- Colour weights were significantly larger already at the start of learning in insight networks
- Varying the level of noise added during gradient updating increased the proportion of networks exhibiting insight-like behaviour
- Adding noise to only weights during the updates was sufficient to induce insight-like behaviour
- Adding noise only to the colour parameter updates quickly led to substantial amounts of insight-like behavioural switches
- Momentary noise fluctuations were mostly responsible for the effects
- Regularisation parameter λ affects two of the key characteristics of human insight -selectivity and delay

## Discussion
- Investigated insight-like learning behaviour in humans and neural networks
- Binary decision making task with hidden regularity
- Subset of regularised neural networks with multiplicative gates of input channels displayed spontaneous, jump-like learning
- Networks exhibited all key characteristics of human insight-like behaviour
- Trained with standard stochastic gradient descent
- Behavioural characteristics of aha-moments can arise from gradual learning mechanisms
- Factors causing insight-like behaviour in L1-networks: noise, attentional gating, regularisation
- Noise, regularisation involved in generation of insights
- Possible link between sleep, synaptic scaling and insight
- Cognitive control as regularised optimisation
- Occurrence of insight-like behaviour specific to L1-regularised networks
- L1-regularisation beneficial in more complex task settings

## Methods

### Task
- Employed perceptual decision task with binary choice about circular arrays of moving dots
- Two features: motion direction (4 orthogonal directions) and colour (orange or purple)
- Noise level of motion feature varied in 5 steps
- Colour difficulty constant
- Task coded in JavaScript
- Participants restricted to use desktops, Firefox or Chrome browser
- 200 moving dots with a radius of 7 pixels each
- Dots had a lifetime of 10 frames before they were replaced
- Trial duration 2000 ms
- Binary feedback symbol (happy or sad smiley)
- Inter trial interval (ITI) of 400, 600, 800 or 1000 ms
- First 400 trials, motion phase, correct binary choice related to stimulus motion
- Two response keys, "X" and "M"
- Motion coherence set to 100% in first block
- Second task block introduced 3 lowest levels of motion noise
- Assessed how well participants had learned to discriminate motion direction after 4th block
- Motion and colour phase, colour feature predictive of correct choice in addition to motion feature
- Last task block, asked participants if they noticed a rule, used colour feature, and replicated mapping between stimulus colour and motion directions

### Human participants
- Recruited participants aged 18-30 online
- Required participants to show learning of stimulus classification
- Probed accuracy on 3 easiest, least noisiest coherence levels
- Excluded 96 participants due to insufficient accuracy
- 99 participants passed accuracy criterion and completed both task phases
- 34 participants excluded due to technical problems or quitting
- All participants gave informed consent
- Protocol approved by local ethics committee
- Participants received 3£ for first task phase, 7£ for both task phases

### Neural networks
- Used same classification procedure for neural networks
- Funding parties had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript

### Modelling of insight-like switches
- Linear model with two free parameters
- Step model with three free parameters
- Sigmoid function with three free parameters
- Preference for sigmoid function over linear and step models

### Human participants
- Modeled human participants' data using sigmoid functions
- Defined criterion to assess whether subject had switched to colour strategy
- Corrected for general fit of data to model
- Identified insight participants whose corrected slope steepness was outside of control group's distribution
- 57.6% of participants indicated they used colour to press correctly, 79.2% of insight participants overlapped with self reports

## Hidden layer model
- Tested task on more complex neural network model
- Applied L1-regularisation on gate weights
- 18.2% of networks exhibited insight-like behaviour
- Applied L2-regularisation on gate weights, 51.5% of networks exhibited insight-like behaviour
- Results mirror observations from one-layer linearity

## Weight and gate differences between l1-and l2-regularised networks
- At correlation onset, motion and colour weights were similar between L1 and L2 networks
- After learning, colour weights were higher in L2 networks than L1 networks
- Gate weights were lower in L1 networks than L2 networks at correlation onset
- After learning, colour gate weights were higher in L2 networks than L1 networks
- After learning, motion gate weights were lower in L2 networks than L1 networks

## Gaussian noise differences at weights and gates between insight and no-insight networks
- Comparing Gaussian noise at weights and gates around switch points revealed no differences between insight and no-insight networks
- No differences in noise at start or end of learning

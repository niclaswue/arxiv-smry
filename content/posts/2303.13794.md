# Paper Content

## Introduction
- Image matching is a classic task in computer vision used in various downstream tasks
- Recently, deep learning models have been developed to implement end-to-end keypoint matching
- Improving the performance of image matching involves reducing incorrect matches and increasing correct matches
- Co-visible area between two images is defined as the "critical region"
- Matching Key-Points Crop (MKPC) algorithm is proposed to locate the critical region effectively and accurately
- Two-stage pipeline is proposed which supports being extended arbitrarily
- MKPC and two-stage pipeline improve image matching performance on PhotoTourism dataset
- Two-stage pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art on Image Matching Challenge 2022 benchmark

### Matching key-points crop (mkpc)
- MKPC algorithm clusters matching key-points between two images
- Workflow is shown in Figure 2
- Three steps: clustering, generating bounding box, cropping area
- Algorithm 1 describes MKPC algorithm flow
- DBSCAN used for clustering
- Outputs cropped critical regions
- Clusters sorted in descending order
- Candidate clustering sets C 1 and C 2 for each image
- 4 points P 1 and P 2 used to crop images I 1 and I 2

### Two-stage pipeline of image matching
- Proposed two-stage pipeline for image matching
- Plug any image matching models into both stages
- Stage 1 produces set of key-points for both images
- MKPC generates cropped critical regions for both images
- Stage 2 produces matched key-points for both images
- Concatenated key-points of both stages fed into RANSAC algorithm

### Crop area expansion (cae)
- Image matching models have a structural problem that can lead to missing co-visible areas
- To address this, a padding operation called Crop Area Expansion (CAE) was designed
- CAE is controlled by two parameters, the horizontal expand factor and the vertical expand factor
- CAE saves the area abandoned by MKPC incorrectly

## Experiments
- Rejects outliers
- Constrains and refines matching in critical areas

### Mkpc with single model for outdoor scenario
- Experiments conducted on PhotoTourism dataset, a subset of YFCC100M dataset
- Metrics used are AUC of pose error at thresholds (5•, 10•, 20•)
- RANSAC and USAC_MAGSAC used to get E matrix
- Two-stage pipeline improves performance of Superpoint + SuperGlue
- Pretrained weights from MegaDepth used for SuperPoint and SuperGlue
- Two-stage pipeline better than ensemble directly

### Mkpc with multiple models for outdoor pose estimation
- IMC2022 benchmark is an outdoor dataset with images pairs with variable degrees
- Bridging the domain gap between images is the main challenge
- Mean Average Accuracy (mAA) is used to evaluate the error in terms of rotation and translation
- Our method outperforms the previous SOTA on both private and public leaderboards

### Mkpc with single model for indoor pose estimation
- ScanNet is a dataset for indoor pose estimation
- Results from SuperGlue are in Table 3
- Our approach cannot surpass the naive ensemble
- Difference between indoor and outdoor scenes affects image matching model
- Quality of key-points generated affects two-stage pipeline

### The time-consumption of the mkpc and the two-stage pipeline
- MKPC is a plug-and-play module that does not require re-training or fine-tuning
- RANSAC filter outliers and finds global optimized F/E/H matrix
- DBSCAN consumes little time and computational resource

## Conclusion
- Hypothesis: Area outside co-visible regions of both images contain little information
- Proposed algorithm: Matching Key-Points Crop (MKPC)
- Two-stage pipeline compatible to any image matching models
- Experiments indicate small but promising effect for outdoor pose estimation
- Method surpasses SOTA of Image Matching Challenge 2022 Benchmark
- Future work: Explore potential of method in model fusion, extend two-stage pipeline to newer models
